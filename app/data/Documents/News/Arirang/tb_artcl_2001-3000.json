South Korea and Japan are caught in another feud of their own.\n\n(Korean, YTN 6\uc6d42\uc77c \uae30\uc0ac) \n \"The Director-General for Asia and Pacific Affairs is going to summon Japan's deputy chief of mission to South Korea this afternoon. We plan to strongly protest Japan's unjust territorial claim over Dokdo and demand an immediate correction.\"\n\n(Japanese, \ub3d9\uc77c\uae30\uc0ac)\n \"We cannot accept South Korea's protest. The IOC has explained that the map presented on the IOC website is objective.\"\n\nLet's talk about it on News In-depth tonight with Ed Hula, Founder of Around the Rings.\nAround the Rings is .... Ed joins us live from Atlanta.\nEd, great to see you again.\n\n \n\n Ed, although a bit too light to notice right away, the dot representing Dokdo, a group of islets at the center of Seoul and Tokyo's long-time territorial feud, is included in Japan's map of Olympics torch relay as part of Japan's territory. \nThe Korean Sport and Olympic Committee has sent a letter to the IOC for mediation, but it is yet to respond. Can we expect a mediating role from the IOC?\n\n According to a recent survey, over 67-percent of South Koreans have responded that they're willing to boycott Tokyo Olympics over the Dokdo controversy. You've covered every Olympic Games since 1992. The South Korean government did make clear today that the map issue will not lead to a boycott of the Games. But, do you recall any case in which the games were used politically, sparking full-blown boycott? \n\n How did involving parties in the cases that you just mentioned resolve the feuds?\n\n Dokdo is just one of Japan's headaches surrounding Tokyo Olympics amid growing oppositions from within the country as Covid-19 continues to batter the island nation. How are the preparations going for the games, now just 45 days away?\nDo you think the games will go ahead despite all odds?\n\n Ed Hula live from Atlanta for us. Thank you for sharing your perspective.",

With the market seeing more and more attorneys every year... advertising has become a key way for them to survive. \n With the start of law schools in South Korea in 2009, there are 1-thousand-500 new attorneys being injected into the market every year. \nYou can see the graph here and its a dramatic increase. \n That said, the number of cases each attorney gets has decreased.\nAccording to the Seoul Bar Association, one attorney gets an average of 1-point-26 cases per month as opposed to nearly 3 in 2011. \n\n So why are lawyers so careful with their advertising?\n\n There's a term \"asymmetric information.\" \n It applies to things like the legal or medical industries... where experts, especially those with licenses, hold much more information than the consumers. \nA lot of the time, all consumers can do is place their trust in the professionals when choosing their best option.\nTake a listen to how it applies to law. \n\n(Korean - \ub0a8)\n \"There are laws regulating the commercials because attorneys could take advantage of the information asymmetries between themselves and the consumers, and could deceive their clients or act in bad faith against their interests.\"\n\n Okay, then how about in other countries?\n\n In the U.S., you can see advertisements for law offices on many different platforms. \nTV, YouTube, signs on the side of buildings, I mean you name it... it's very different compared to here in Korea. \nIn Japan, where there are more attorneys than Korea but a smaller number of annual cases being filed... advertising through platforms is not seen as being a problem.\n\n So going back to the domestic issue at hand... what does the future hold for the two groups -- attorneys and those who need them?\n\n No one can be sure, but many say that platforms like LawTalk may bring down the barrier between consumers and lawyers, but that a close watch is what's needed.\n\n(Korean - \ub0a8)\n \"I think it would be better for the associations to watch the ads that come up closely, and hold individuals responsible rather than closing down platforms.\"\n\nThe goal for both groups is to match the best attorney for people who need lawyers. \nBut how to achieve that and who the best attorneys actually are is a different matter.\n\n Okay, that was from our Kim Do-yeon.

It recommended 'acetaminophen' painkillers but said when one can't get ahold of them, 'ibuprofen' painkillers are also fine. The WHO had once recommended against the use of 'ibuprofen' painkillers citing possible interference in forming antibodies. What are your thoughts?\n\n Moderna's Chief Commercial Officer Corrine Le Goff, in an interview with a local news outlet, said that Moderna is reviewing ways to produce mRNA vaccine substance in South Korea hinting at a possible cooperation not just in manufacturing but also in the field of research. How do you see this, and is Korea ready to produce mRNA vaccine substance?\n\n The Seoul city government has announced that the number of cumulative new variant cases in the capital stood at 101 as of June 1 with no major spikes in figures. 57 was locally transmitted while 44 were imported. Is the threat of new variants now within a controllable range?\n\n Authorities are now finalizing a reform of the social distancing system to simplify the levels from 5 to 4, while minimizing business and gathering bans for each level. How do you assess government's new social distancing plan?\n\n Amid boosted vaccination rate, Korea is now expected to reach the goal of inoculating 13 million at an earlier date than the targeted date of June 30th. But third-quarter vaccination rate will be critical in reaching herd immunity by November. What are some possible obstacles?\n\n Dr.Tan, thank you as always for your insights.",

Michele: There's a strong disparity between rich and poor countries in administering vaccines. The COVAX alliance has not managed to provide enough vaccines to developing nations as scheduled, and countries with enough supplies appear to be employing vaccine diplomacy. Has the Western world failed developing countries?\n\n2. Jack: According to Oxfam, low-income countries are vaccinating at a rate of 62-thousand people per day. At that rate it will take them 57 years to vaccinate their entire population. What does this mean for developing countries?\nWhich sectors of developing economies have been hit the most due to the pandemic? \n\n3. Michele: The U.S. had initially been pushing for a patent waiver for COVID-19 vaccine technology. However, the UK and the EU are arguing that this doesn\u2019t immediately solve the problem. What\u2019s your view on this?\n\n4. Jack: There's been some opposition to the idea of introducing patent waivers to ramp up production of vaccines in developing countries. How would the rate of vaccinations affect the pace of economic recovery in developing countries, and are patent waivers the best way forward?\n\n5. Jack: Rich countries have rolled out massive investment plans to build back better from the pandemic. What kind of support do developing economies need at this point to stabilise their national economies as well as the livelihoods of their people?\n\n6. Michele: It\u2019s clear pharmaceutical companies aren\u2019t happy about patent waivers. Can they be incentivised or convinced to share their technology?\n\n7. Jack: What kind of progress do you hope to see from the G7 summit coming up over the weekend to address COVID-19 vaccine distribution?\n\n8. Michele: How do you hope to see the issue addressed at the G7 summit coming up over the weekend?\n\nMichele Goodwin, Chancellor's Professor and Founding Director at Center for Biotechnology & Global Health Policy, University of California, Irvine, and Jack Gao, Program Economist, Institute for New Economic Thinking.\nThank you for your insights.\n(California) - \ub179\ud654 \n\n(New York)",

Many know that she's a singer in South Korea, and she's getting a lot of likes. I hope she becomes more famous in South Korea, because it's a country famous for its music and K-pop.\"  \n\nAs members of a minority tribe, Wanyiwah's parents fled from Myanmar's ethnic persecution and settled in Thailand.\nBut after Wanyihwa's father passed away, her mother decided to move to South Korea... where she thought her daughter would have a better chance of becoming a singer.\nAs a cash-strapped single mother and refugee, Wanyihwa's mother struggled to support her three children.\nBut after her talents were recognized, people started offering Wanyihwa help and she began singing on stage.\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec) \n \"Music is my life and my friend. Since my father used to be a singer, music has been a part of me since I was a baby... Also, I'm so happy that I can make my mother happy because becoming a singer was her dream as well and she worked so hard to make that happen for me.\"\n\nNow Wanyiwah is using her talents to spread hope to her motherland, Myanmar, through the song, \"the Spring of Myanmar.\"\n\n(SOV-English)\n\"Shall the three fingers bloom into flowers, Myanmar\"\n(\uc138 \uc190\uac00\ub77d \uaf43 \ub418\uc5b4 \ud53c\uc5b4\ub098\ub77c \ubbf8\uc580\ub9c8)\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec) \n\"I define Myanmar's spring as a time when kids my age can just play happily without fear. Right now, I'm in Korea having a good time with my friends but I know my friends in Myanmar are going through tough, scary times. I really hope \"spring\" comes to them soon.\" \n\n Wanyiwah's music teacher, Lee Kyung-ja, has high hopes for her.\n She hopes that Wanyiwah grows up to be not just a singer, but also a representative of both Korea and Myanmar and a delegator of peace.\nKim Yeon-seung, Arirang News",

That will be the first time that North Korea has missed a summer Olympics since it boycotted the 1988 Games in Seoul. North Korean athletes have done pretty well in certain sports at the Olympic Games when we look at previous events. Boycotting the Tokyo Games altogether. What does this tell us about the impact of Covid-19 on the isolated regime?\n\n President Moon had previously expressed hopes that Tokyo Olympics could be a chance to resume inter-Korean dialogue, as well as Pyeongyang-Washington dialogue. What are the implications of the North's Olympic absence to denuclearization efforts?\n\n The Workers' Party's Powerful Central Committee is set to meet this week to review state affairs during the first half 2021. The meeting will take place just ahead of the G7 Summit where South Korea-U.S.-Japan summit could be held. Would Kim Jong-un send a message to Seoul or Washington?\n\n Revamping North Korea's crippled economy will likely take center stage at the central committee's big meeting... as Kim Jong-un presented to senior officials his economic plan that intends to bring \"tangible change\" to stabilizing people's living conditions on Tuesday, according to state media. Is Kim prioritizing economic recovery over military power, and what does it entail?\n\n UN nuclear watchdog the IAEA said earlier this week that there are indications in North Korea of possible reprocessing work to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel which could be used in nuclear weapons. The agency had also raised possibility of North Korea's uranium enrichment in Kangson, a potential enrichment site near Pyeongyang, last year. Three and a half years into its absence of nuclear tests, could North Korea be gearing up to resume nuclear detonations?\n\n Exactly a year ago today, North Korea unilaterally severed all communication channels with South Korea in protest against North Korean defector group's flying of anti-North propaganda leaflets. The unification ministry today revealed that Seoul has been contacting Pyeongyang every morning through the Panmunjeom channel, but there hasn't been any meaningful response. What possible options are left on the table to reengage North Korea in dialogue?\n\n Thank you as always for your time. We appreciate it.",

What's now just a chapter in the history books is very much current affairs another part of the world. \nJust last week, a group of 20 young people of 11 nationalities including South Korea, Germany, Russia, Iran and Vietnam cycled through the heart of the German capital -- a symbolic 13-kilometer stretch from the Mauerpark, making stops at the South Korean embassy, the North Korean embassy and the Statue of Peace. \nThey were biking for a cause: for One Korea. \n\nBiking for a Korean reunification in Berlin: joining us live from the German capital is the organizer of this rally, Chaewon Yoo. Chaewon is a graduate school student and author of \"Cycling the Silk Road\". \n\n\n\n \n\n So, tell me, Chaewon. What initiated, motivated you to organize this biking for Korean reunification campaign? Tell us about what inspired you to organize this, why you chose the 13 kilometer path that you did and who took part in the event.\n\n I saw you and 19 others who biked with you sing \"Arirang Alone\" at different stops in Berlin... and you sharing sometimes painful history of the two Koreas with those who may not be too familiar with that time period in this part of the world. \nWhat kind of a message did you want to deliver?\n\n I must confess, I was quite moved by seeing you and 19 others cycling, singing Arirang Alone, and chanting One Korea in the middle of Berlin. \nWhat were the reactions from the locales? Did the German people respond in any way? What about when you were in front of the North Korean embassy?\n\n As a student and a writer with deep interest in social issues, what do you think is the most important lesson Korea can learn from fall of the Berlin Wall? How do the average Germans feel about the reunification more than three decades later? \n\n What are your immediate to long term goals and aspirations now? \n\n Chae-won Yoo joining us live from Berlin for us tonight. Thank you for sharing your very special story with us.",

VACCINATED.\nFor more... I have Kim Do-yeon (\uae40\ub3c4\uc5f0)... here... in the studio.\nWelcome... Do-yeon (\ub3c4\uc5f0).\n\n Good afternoon, Sunhee.\n\n So... the GIST... here... in Korea... is to seek... TRAVEL BUBBLES... with some of its neighbors?\n\n Yes. If realized,... the travel bubble will make group tours possible,... between Korea and several other countries,... so as long as there's a bilateral agreement.\nWith a negative PCR test result... and a vaccine certificate,... people can travel to countries within the bubble,... and they will not be subject to quarantine,... if they test negative for COVID-19 upon returning.  \n Korea is currently negotiating a travel bubble... with Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand among other countries. \nLooking more broadly,... Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Palau have already... or are planning to implement such a system.\nHealth authorities believe this is an important first step... in reviving the travel industry. \n\n(Korean - \ub0a8) June 9, 2021\n \"Broader exchanges with countries through a travel bubble will provide more convenience for citizens,\u2026 aid the recovery of the tourism and aviation industries,\u2026 while effectively containing the spread of imported cases.\"\n\n I'm sure... INDUSTRY PLAYERS are APPLAUDING... this TRAVEL INITIATIVE. \n\n Right, so I spoke to a representative from a local travel agency,... and he sounded very excited. \nHe said the company already has overseas tour packages... in the works right now. Take a listen.\n\n(Korean - \ub0a8)  \uc804\ud654\uc778\ud130\ubd80 \uc0ac\uc9c4 0\n \"We're certainly glad to see the government laying the groundwork for a resumption in travel. We've already created packages for countries where travel is possible,... since they are reopening their borders one by one.\"\n\n AND... what... Do-yeon... has been the PUBLIC RESPONSE?\n\n Well, as of now,... there aren't many people who meet the full requirements... to resume traveling. \nSo,... even though eased restrictions are likely to come into effect starting July,... we probably won't see a pickup in travel... until about a month or so later. \n\n(Korean - \ub0a8)  \uc804\ud654\uc778\ud130\ubd80 \uc0ac\uc9c4 0\n \"We haven't seen any notable differences in the number of calls and inquiries coming in, since vaccinations are a requirement. We believe many people will have been fully-vaccinated by September, so we're expecting an increase in travel to occur sometime in September or October.\"\n\n MEANWHILE... what should travellers... keep in mind... when planning... to venture... overseas?\n\n Right,... the usual exercise in prevention... we can all visualize... since we've been living with COVID-19 for more than a year. \n But one thing to keep in mind... is that travel will only be allowed... in group tour packages. \nVacationing solo is not an option for now,... to allow health authorities to better monitor the travelers... and respond to any outbreaks.\nIn addition... travelers will only be allowed to take direct flights... between Korea and a partnering country. \nThey are also required to have stayed in Korea... for two weeks prior to their departure date.\nThe same requirements apply vice versa... to those coming to Korea from partnering countries.\n\n Sounds promising... BUT... I hear... there is STILL... MUCH WORK... AHEAD?\n\n Right. For example,... there are still no rules yet... on the maximum number of travelers in one group.\n But, when the rules are eventually set,... the government is looking to better enforce them... by assigning chaperones... to make sure tour groups comply with local prevention guidelines. \nThey may even delegate some authority... to the tour guides leading the groups. \nThe government believes the sharing of responsibility... may lead to better prevention.\n\n(\uc190\uc601\ub798 \uc911\uc218\ubcf8 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc804\ub7b5\ubc18\uc7a5) \n(Korean - \ub0a8) June 9, 2021 \n \"Compliance to prevention guidelines will be the responsibility of not only individual travelers,... but travel agencies as well,... and we will strengthen our containment efforts,... through this double layer of accountability.\" \n\n  All right, hopefully, everything is clearer in the near future and we can finally take vacations abroad soon. \nThank you, Do-yeon. \n\n Thank you.",

What can they do to prove their solidarity? \n\n2.\n Professor Shaffer: In your view, what kind of outcome would make this G7 summit meaningful?\n\n3.\n Professor Shaffer: The idea of inviting the guest participants actually came about last year when Fmr. President Donald Trump asked the three countries to attend. It seems the U.S. wants all Quad countries and South Korea in the G7 club. What do you think G7 members are hoping to see from these middle power countries, particularly South Korea?\n\n4.\nWhat does this G7 meeting mean for South Korea? What can it contribute?\n\n5.\nJapanese media reports indicate Tokyo is opposed to South Korea joining the G7 meeting and is reluctant to hold a bilateral summit on the side. What do you think the reason is -- especially when Japan is supposedly committed to strengthening trilateral ties with Washington?\n\n6.\nProfessor Shaffer: There's been much debate over vaccine patents. The U.S. and the EU have been divided over finding a practical way forward to get the whole world vaccinated, especially countries that are experiencing severely high infection and fatality rates. Do you think they will be able to find middle ground on how to supply and distribute vaccines?\n\n7.\nDr. Kim: On trade, how do you think G7 countries are going to rebuild their trade links and supply chains, particularly on highly sensitive technologies? There's been a lot of talk about the possible conception of the so-called 'D10' club of democratic partners, including G7 countries South Korea, Australia and India. A T-12 of techno-democracies has also been suggested. Should we expect to see these countries turn into a D-10, or T-12? \n\n8.\nProfessor Shaffer: China is expected to be discussed extensively at this meeting, and there's anticipation the G7 countries will collaborate to challenge China's Belt Road Initiative with an infrastructure plan of its own. What would this look like?\n\n\nThat was Dr. Kim Byung-joo, Professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies and\nDr. Gregory Shaffer, Professor at the University of California, Irvine. Thank you for your insights today.\n(Seoul)\n\n(California) - \ub179\ud654",

Reasserting the United States on the world stage, his message was in great contrast to his predecessor's \"America First\" stance.\n\n (English) Reuters 3189   10/06/2021\n\"...we are going to make it clear that the United States is back and democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges and the issues that matter most to our future.\"\n\n In his speech, Biden also highlighted that the West must publicly demonstrate it can compete economically with China as the world emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. During his trip, he also aims to reassure European states that the United States can once again be counted on as a dependable partner in standing up to Russia's aggression. \nBiden warned that the U.S. will respond in a \"robust and meaningful way\" if Russia engages in \"harmful activities\". Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently stated that a \"new Cold War\" is underway, undermining Western economies, alliances and political systems. \n\nThe U.S. President is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ahead of the two-day G7 Summit, followed by a meeting with the Queen, and NATO and U.S.-EU summits.  Ending his trip on the 16th will be his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva with an aim of establishing a more stable and predictable relationship.\nLee Eunjin, Arirang News.",

During his trip, he also aims to reassure European states that the United States can once again be counted on as a dependable partner in standing up to Russia's aggression. \nBiden warned that the U.S. will respond in a \"robust and meaningful way\" if Russia engages in \"harmful activities\". Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently stated that a \"new Cold War\" is underway, undermining Western economies, alliances and political systems. \n\nThe U.S. President is scheduled to meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ahead of the two-day G7 Summit, followed by a meeting with the Queen, and NATO and U.S.-EU summits.  Ending his trip on the 16th will be his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva with an aim of establishing a more stable and predictable relationship.\nLee Eunjin, Arirang News.",

A little over 1 million doses were recently shipped,... which means the same number of people will be fully vaccinated with the product,... which only requires a single dose. Roughly 234,000 are expected to receive their shots on the first day. Janssen inoculations for pre-registered applicants are to be completed on June 20th. Meanwhile,... surplus vaccines will be prioritized for seniors aged 60 and above. \n\n Let's shift our focus abroad,... and to a number of countries that are seeing their highest figures in months,... Russia's Wednesday caseload topped 10,000,... for the first time in more than three months,... with over 4,100 in Moscow alone,... that being the biggest tally since mid-January.

        "artcl_ctt": "It's Friday and that means it's time for our weekly 'Life With Culture' segment to let us know what's going on this weekend.\nOur culture correspondent Kim Bo-kyoung is here at the studio. Bo-kyoung,... I heard there is a special exhibition that gives people a taste of Czech puppetry?\n\nYes Conn-young,... listed as a UNESCO World Heritage in 2016,... Czech puppetry is a popular leisure activity in the Czech Republic, with over two-hundred years of history. (\ud504\ub86c\ud130\ubd04) It originally served as a way of communicating between cities,... and it is still deeply engraved in the lives of Czechs. More than one-hundred puppets have been sent from a museum in the Czech Republic for the special exhibition that has been set up in the Seoul Museum of History, free of charge. \nLet's take a peek at the Czechs' cultural asset.\n\n\nPuppets are an essential part of Czech culture,... playing a role as guardians of the Czech language and national consciousness. \nThe Seoul Museum of History, in cooperation with the Chrudim Puppetry Museum, is holding a special exhibition titled \"Secrets of Wooden Puppets - Czech Marionettes.\"\n\n(Standup/ed:Steve)\n\"Czech puppetry's origin comes from nomadic puppeteers in the 18th century. Most of them travelled around with their whole family, carrying fully decorated stages in their caravans, and performing at pubs, fairs, and town squares.\"\n\nWith increasing popularity, more and more puppet theaters were formed over time,... and even now,... professional theaters in the Czech Republic maintain the tradition. \n\n(ENGLISH/\ub0a8)\n\"We are very proud of it, because it is really part of rich cultural and historical life. The puppetry changed now it is mostly done now in the theaters and also the characters changed with the time but they always try to reflect the life and society and when you visit the theaters you really experience daily lives on the stage shown in very artistic way.\"\n\nBringing Czech culture to Seoul required careful planning due to the difficulties of international travel.\n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"We were finally able to do the exhibition thanks to Chrudim Puppetry Museum's decision to send exhibits without curators. This is the first time for Seoul City to receive the items like this. Due to the limited number of flights, we made sure the items arrived much earlier than usual -- three weeks before,... and our curators installed the exhibits, coordinating with local Czech curators remotely.\"\n\n(CZECH/\uc5ec) SKYPE\n\"I think that we are the first institution that received such export permission without the presence of a curator from the Ministry of Culture probably in last 50 years. The opportunity to hold an exhibition about Czech puppetry in such a distant country as South Korea actually means bringing a European or absolutely different phenomenon to another culture.\"\n\nLast year marked the 30th year of diplomatic relations between two countries,... and though delayed, the exhibition gives visitors a unique taste of Czech culture. (PKG\ub05d)\n\n(STUDIO BACK)\nWhat a great opportunity to feel as if we were on a trip to the Czech Republic. I also heard that people could have a rare chance to take a look at the inside of the Haeinsa Temple Janggyeong Panjeon,... the Depositories for the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks?\n\nThat's right,... you see the Tripitaka Koreana Woodblocks or so-called 'Palman Daejanggyeong' is the most complete collection of Buddhist texts, (\ud504\ub86c\ud130\ubd04) engraved on 80-thousand woodblocks during the 13th century when the Goryeo Dynasty was suffering from wars against the Mongols.\nDesignated as a National Treasure of Korea and inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2007,... this cultural asset is the world\u2019s most comprehensive and oldest intact version of the entire Buddhist scriptures. \nBeing the important asset,... visitors to the Haeinsa Temple haven't been allowed to go in and see the Tripitaka Koreana,... but the temple has now decided to let a limited number of visitors enjoy the asset every weekend. \n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8)\n\"For those who are very tired of overcoming COVID-19,... we have decided to open up the interior of the Janggyeong Panjeon starting June 19th through Internet reservations.\"\n\nJust twenty people are allowed on the tours, which run at 10 AM and 2 PM every Saturday and Sunday\nReservations are on a first-come-first-served basis, and can be made through the Haeinsa Temple website. \nMeanwhile,... the Cultural Heritage Administration is creating special events for those who've been vaccinated.\nThese include a Moonlight Tour at Changdeokgung Palace which starts on June 23rd. \nTo enjoy the nighttime tour and take a look at the beauty of the palace, those eligible just have to send a registration email by Saturday. \nA music concert held at Seokjojeon Hall at Deoksugung Palace on June 30th,... is also only available for those fully vaccinated, who can apply for it through deoksugung.go.kr website.\n\nThank you Bo-kyoung as always for sharing this cultural information. I will see you next week. \n\nThank you.",

Thank you for coming on today.\n\n Good afternoon.\n\n The World Bank is now calling for the global economy to grow by the most in almost half a century... at 5-point-6 percent. This economic growth and recovery is happening primarily in wealthy countries, so it seems this will make inequality worse. Tell us about that, and what's driving this extraordinary growth.\n\n \n\n\n\n Stocks in New York closed lower overnight as investors watching inflation. New meme stocks also surging, which some investors are alarmed by. The S&P down almost point-2 percent, the Nasdaq down about a tenth of a percent. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n \n\n\n\n In the Korean market, options were expiring today, and though the market lacked direction on opening it did post a solid gain, especially tech shares on the KOSDAQ. Tell us about the local market.\n\n \n\n\n\n The price of raw materials and commodities have risen so much lately, but with so many factors at work, some analysts say it's hard to tell whether or not we are at the start of a new supercycle. In any case, it's said that if materials prices globally go up 10 percent, then Korea's consumer prices will go up by two percent. What do you see happening in terms of a supercycle?\n\n \n\n\n\n Korea's exports so far this year have been remarkably strong. According to a survey of analysts by the Federation of Korean Industries, they think this good run could come to an end in the second half of this year... for computers, petrochemicals, displays and a few other sectors. Professor, tell us about that survey, and what you make of it and the export situation.",

I hope I don't see any of the victims. That was my biggest concern. I got several phone calls while watching TV since I've lived here for more than 40 years. I've never seen anything like this.\" \n\n(KOREAN-\ub0a8) \n \"It's so awful. I often pass by here on my way to the hospital where my child works. I was worried about the safety of it to be honest. However, I was still really surprised when I heard what happened. \n\nPolice officers and firefighters have been here all night, surveying the scene and looking for survivors. \nAnd on Thursday a special investigation team was created... to ensure a much quicker and more strictly controlled probe.\nSo far as of Thursday, no additional victims have been reported.\n\nWon-jong, we also heard that the South Korean government is taking strict action by ordering a further investigation into the incident as well. \nTell us more.  \n\n That's right. First of all, South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday afternoon has expressed his deepest condolences to the victims and their families.\nPresident Moon ordered the local government and the ministries of land and safety to come up with medical aid and support for the funerals. \nEnsuring such a tragedy never happens again, he also urged a thorough probe to find out the exact cause of the collapse.\nEarlier this afternoon, South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum arrived at the scene and gave a briefing.\n\n(KOREAN-\ub0a8) \n \"Right now, there are many places being demolished across the nation but we can't let this tragedy happen again. We will thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident.\" \n\nPrime Minister Kim also visited the funeral for the victims.\nMeanwhile, HDC Hyundai Development Company chairman -- Chung Mong-gyu officially apologized for the incident in Gwangju. \nAs the site under ongoing re-development was under his supervision, Chung promised to do anything he can to help the victims and their families as well as to prevent anything like this from happening again.\nThat's all I have you for now. \nBack to you, Conn-young.",

Why don't you give us a brief intro of this beautiful, historic and innovative region?\n\n What does the choice of Corwall as the location for the summit mean? For a summit focused on building back better from the coronavirus pandemic?\n\n I'm sure the county is now surrounded by layers of air-tight security. Give us a glimpse into the security preparations.\n\n This year's summit will mark the first G7 leaders' meeting since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. What anti-virus quarantine measures are in place to ensure safety?\n\n America's Rushmore-style sculpture of the G7 leaders was erected in Cornwall using electronic waste, and according to the sculpture, it was built to \"make them realize they're all together in this waste business.\" Tell us more about 'Mount Recyclemore' and also about anti-G7 protests.\n\n The leaders' meeting itself will be held in the coastal town of Carbis Bay, supported by neighboring St. Ives and other towns across the region. So, the whole of Cornwall will reap the benefits of hosting the G7. What's your estimate on the total economic impact for the county?\n\n Malcolm Bell, joining us live from Cornwall, UK for us. Thank you for your insights.",

Nonetheless, vaccination levels still vary widely in the region. Could you first give us a comparison of vaccination levels by countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and where does South Korea stand?\n\n How is the faster pace of vaccinations observed in some countries impacting their economies?\n\n Currently South Korea's fitch ratings stand at AA-/Stable, while China's stand at A+/Stable and Japan's at A/Negative. What are the key considerations in ratings assessment of Asian sovereigns during the pandemic?\n\n Public debt dynamics are a key part of sovereign grading. How do you assess South Korea's level of national debt which is now nearing a debt-to-GDP ratio of 50%? How does it compare with other major Asian economies?\n\n No one is safe until everyone is safe, and many experts point out that low vaccination and high infection rates in some parts of the world will ultimately lead to huge economic losses even for countries with high vaccination rates. What are your thoughts on this, and how can countries with low vaccination rate cushion the economic impact?\n\n How soon do you expect Asian economies to return to pre-pandemic economic levels given the current pace of vaccinations?\n\n Stephen SCHWARTZ at Fitch Ratings joining us live from Hong Kong.

ONE DOSE... of the COVID-19 vaccine... to OVER... 10-MILLION people?\n\n That\u2019s right,... we\u2019ve passed the 10 million mark now... as of 12 am Friday. A total of 10.56 million people have received their first doses,... accounting for over 20 percent of the country's population.\n\n 2.63 million people, or around 5 percent of the population,... have been fully-vaccinated. Health authorities have set a goal... of inoculating 14 million people by the end of this month,... and 36 million by September. The KDCA chief expressed her optimism,... that more vaccinations could help Korea bring down the number of infections. \n\n \"We're expecting a steeper decline in the daily caseloads after mid-July, when we have inoculated more than a quarter of our population, provided that we continue to maintain our prevention efforts.\" \n\n The country is hoping to achieve herd immunity,... earlier than its original timeline of November... as vaccinations pick up pace. The government also plans to offer more incentives to vaccinated people... to boost its inoculation campaign. It is working to allow fully vaccinated citizens to travel overseas in groups,... as early as in July.\n\n INOCULATIONS... using... Janssen vaccines... also kicked off... on Thursday... right?\n\n That\u2019s correct, Sunny...Thursday was Day One...where the country began administering Janssen vaccines supplied by the U.S. government,... for those in the military,... including reserve forces, civil defense personnel... and others.\n\n More than a quarter-million people received Janssen's single-dose vaccine on Day 1. And those who got their shots on Thursday... appeared to be happy and relieved.\n\n \"I had to wait a while,... but I feel relieved that I've gotten my shot.\"  \n\n Of the over one million doses received from the US,... roughly 90 percent of them are being given to those... between the ages of 30 and 60,... working in national defense or foreign affairs. Health authorities first started taking reservations on June 1st... for 900-thousand doses,... and all of them were fully-booked in just 18 hours. The other 110-thousand doses are being kept in reserve... for people who have to leave the country quickly... for important public functions or business affairs,... and residents living in the country's most remote regions.\n\n All right... Sung-hyun... as always... thank you... for that coverage.",

Most of them travelled around with their whole family, carrying fully decorated stages in their caravans, and performing at pubs, fairs, and town squares.\"\n\nWith increasing popularity, more and more puppet theaters were formed over time,... and even now,... professional theaters in the Czech Republic maintain the tradition. \n\n(ENGLISH/\ub0a8)\n\"We are very proud of it, because it is really part of rich cultural and historical life. The puppetry changed now it is mostly done now in the theaters and also the characters changed with the time but they always try to reflect the life and society and when you visit the theaters you really experience daily lives on the stage shown in very artistic way.\"\n\nBringing Czech culture to Seoul required careful planning due to the difficulties of international travel.\n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"We were finally able to do the exhibition thanks to Chrudim Puppetry Museum's decision to send exhibits without curators. This is the first time for Seoul City to receive the items like this. Due to the limited number of flights, we made sure the items arrived much earlier than usual -- three weeks before,... and our curators installed the exhibits, coordinating with local Czech curators remotely.\"\n\n(CZECH/\uc5ec) SKYPE\n\"I think that we are the first institution that received such export permission without the presence of a curator from the Ministry of Culture probably in last 50 years. The opportunity to hold an exhibition about Czech puppetry in such a distant country as South Korea actually means bringing a European or absolutely different phenomenon to another culture.\"\n\nLast year marked the 30th year of diplomatic relations between two countries,... and though delayed, the exhibition gives visitors a unique taste of Czech culture. \nKim Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.",

Thanks for coming on today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Let's start with the markets. An inflation number from the U.S. that exceeded expectations at 5 percent for May. Despite that, the S&P rose to a new high. Even higher during the session, actually. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n \n\n\n\n Korean stocks today higher as well. The KOSPI now above 32-40... and the KOSDAQ back at 9-90. Investors seem to think that even the five-percent inflation number won't be enough to get the Fed to raise rates. Tell us about the local market.\n\n \n\n\n\n The Governor of the Bank of Korea, Lee Ju-yeol, has signaled that he will eventually be pulling back on the BOK's monetary easing policy at the appropriate time. Until now, it had been pretty clear that the BOK would stand pat on rates, but this would indicate that we're getting closer to that point. What do you make of his remarks?\n\n \n\n \n\n Korea's export and import prices are rising, which is perhaps not a surprise. These figures are converted into Korean won. But from a year earlier, exports in May were up more than 12 percent and imports almost 14 percent. What's happening there?",

This marks the third time a G7 chair has invited South Korea although last year's meeting was cancelled due to Covid-19. What significance does it hold, and why is South Korea considered as an important partner for G7?\n\n President Biden, ahead of the summit, announced that the U.S. will donate 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccine for low and mid-income countries, hinting that the G7 nations will also announce the full scope of their commitment at the summit. What role can South Korea play in expanding and accelerating the world's covid vaccine supply and distribution?\n\n It's no secret that one primary goal of the summit is to form a united front among like-minded democratic states against the rise of China. Just a few days ahead of the big gathering, foreign ministers of South Korea and China held phone talks where Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi slammed Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy and quite bluntly urged Seoul not to be misled and adhere to the 'correct position'. What would be a desirable strategy for President Moon who will be sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with the G7 leaders at the summit?\n\n During the second session on achieving open society and economy, President Biden will likely take the lead in forging collective action against the rising threat of China. Ahead of the summit he said \"G7 plans to launch an ambitious effort to support resilience around the world by investing in high-quality, high-standard physical, digital, and health infrastructures.\" Would G7 + 3 nations draw up specific agreements in those areas that are now deemed critical to national security, and what would it mean to China?\n\n The new version of the Atlantic Charter was signed by Biden and Johnson, 80 years after the original version was drafted during World War II. The new charter reflects shifting paradigm and threats. What are the implications to the Asia-Pacific region and to South Korea?\n\n Another key issue is whether the leaders of South Korea, U.S. and Japan will hold a trilateral summit, or a \"pull-aside\" meeting. Do you expect any form of talks among the three, and if so, what will likely take center stage?\n(If not, what are some major obstacles hampering their get-together?)\n\n Climate change is also high on the agenda. Would the leaders be able to draw up realistic and pragmatic ways to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050?  \n\n Why were India, Australia and South Africa invited, and how do you see the possibility of the G7 expanding to the G11 Summit? According to the Financial Times, G7 member nations took up 80% of the world's total GDP when the group was formed in 1975, but now only takes up around 40%. \n\n President Moon will make state visits to Austria and Spain after the summit. What significance does it hold?\n\n Professor Kim Hyun-wook of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy for us. Thank you.",

I want to emphasize \"co-existence\" the most.\"\n\uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc774 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc8fc\uc168\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ubaa9\uc801\uc5b4\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ud798\uc744 \uc2e4\uc5b4\uc11c \uc77d\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\uc800\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc774 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc744 \ub4e4\uc5ec\ub193\uc73c\uc168\uace0\uc694. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc9c0\uae08\ubd80\ud130 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub098\uac00\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc18d\uc5d0 \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc758 \uc9c0\ubd84\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740 \uac83\uc740 \uacf5\uc874\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n Lee, an entrepreneur-turned politician, has been the face of the party's younger generation since 2011, despite never being a lawmaker.\nHis victory signals supporters' demand for a generational switch; away from old faces with younger generations wanting their voices heard and a change in the political arena. \n This was reflected by a significant lead in the votes from private citizens via phone and the Internet... which accounted for 70 percent of the final tally.\nLee is already responding by changing the way his party will appoint new positions, such as by making contenders for party spokesperson debate over the position.\nHowever... his biggest task will be leading the party into the Presidential Election next year... including the primaries. \n\n(Korean - \ub0a8)\n \"You have to be more open when the younger generation speaks. Blind criticism just because you don't support the candidate will not be tolerated.\"\n\uc80a\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc758\uacac\uc744 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ud558\uba74 \uad00\ub300\ud574\uc838\uc57c \ud558\uace0\uc694. \ub0b4\uac00 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub300\uc120\ud6c4\ubcf4\ub77c\uace0 \ud574\uc11c \ub9f9\ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc695\ubd80\ud130 \ud558\ub294 \uc57c\ub9cc\uc740 \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c \uc6a9\ub0a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n Lee spoke with President Moon Jae-in over the phone following his win.\nMoon told Lee that this was not only a historical victory, but also a sign of change in Korean society. \n Lee also told the President that the People Power Party will try to be helpful to the government in the fight against COVID-19.\nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News.",

South Korea also had its own agenda heading into the summit.\nAs the leaders kick off their final day of the beachside summit, I have a group of diplomatic and political experts from around the world.\n\nFirst, joining us from Wien is Professor Michael Reiterer of Brussels School of Governance, EU Ambassador retired. Ambassador Reiterer previously served as the Ambassador of the European Union to South Korea. \n\n(Wien) \n\n\nFrom Britain, Dr. John Nilsson-Wright, Senior Research Fellow for Northeast Asia with the Asia-Pacific Programme at Chatham House.\n\n(Cambridge) \n\n\nAND Stephen Noerper, Professor of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University and a seinor advisor to the United Nations program on Northeast Asia. \nDr. Noerper also served as a senior analyst for the U.S. State Department in previous administrations.\n\n(Hawaii) \n\n\n\nWelcome gentlemen to the show. It's great to see you all. Thanks for joining us.\n\n So, as the leaders wrap up their final day of the three-day summit, all eyes are on what the joint communique will carry... or how many times China will be mentioned in the statement.  \nThe G7 leaders are still debating how strongly to respond to China's effort to win influence around the world and rebuke it over alleged forced labor practices. Apparently, some G7 leaders disagree with U.S. President Joe Biden's push for a collective hawkish stance against China. \nHow successful will President Biden be in better positioning the U.S. and its allies to compete with China in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and confronting China's authoritarianism?\n\n(Stephen Noerper)\n\n Where is the UK in this?\n\n(John Nilsson-Wright)\n\n And, the European Union -- I mean, it is pretty apparent that there are disagreements within the EU itself among member countries on their approach to China. I wonder how effective their China policy will be if there is France's China policy, Germany's China policy rather than an EU-wide coherent policy.\n\n(Michael Reiterer)\n\n So, the G7 leaders are aiming to end their first summit in two years with a punchy set of promises including vaccinating the world against coronavirus, making huge corporations pay their fair share of taxes and tackling climate change with a blend of technology and money.\nNon-G-7 nations India, South Korea, Australia and South Africa were invited to attend as guests.\nWhat does this G7 'extras' guest list reveal about UK's foreign policy aims?\n\n(John Nilsson-Wright)\n\n What was South Korean President Moon Jae-in able to bring to the G7 table and what kind of a role did South Korea play?\n\n(Michael Reiterer) \n\n As the summit focus on ways the democracies can collaborate to build a more inclusive and fair global economy and compete with rising (quote) autocracies like China, leaders of the G7 plus the invited nations are expected to be discussing ways to respond to forced labor in supply chains, pursue an affirmative infrastructure initiative that\u2019s high standards and transparent and coordinating on supply chain resilience and technology standards so that democracies are aligned and supporting each other.\nWhat would be the best strategy for President Moon?\n\n** Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a phone conversation with Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong on the eve of the G7 summit, slammed Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy and quite bluntly urged Seoul not to be misled and adhere to the 'correct position'.***\n\n(Stephen Noerper)\n\n China today pointedly cautioned G7 leaders that the days when \"small\" groups of countries decided the fate of the world was long gone, hitting back at the Group of Seven which have sought a unified position over Beijing. How relevant is the G7 in 2021? Is there a need for the informal gathering to be expanded and evolve to a D-10, perhaps?\n\n(Michael Reiterer)\n\n There had been talks of a possible sitdown -- if not, even a pull aside between Moon, Biden and Suga OR one between Moon and Suga this time -- considering how initimate the setting is at this beachside sort heading to the G7 summit in Cornwall this year. Apparently not. All we've heard is that President Moon and Prime Minister Suga exchanged a short hellos. Not even a small informal chat... what does this say about the trilateral and Seoul, Tokyo bilateral relations?\n\nDr. Nilsson-Wright?\n\n Do you want to add your perspective, Dr. Noerper?\n\n And, what are your thoughts and forecast for the ties, Dr. Reiterer?\n\n Well, with a series of multilateral and bilateral engagements this coming week with most of the leaders at Carbis Bay reconvening in Brussels for a NATO meeting Monday, Mr. Biden's first summit with his Russian counterpart in Geneva AND South Korean President Moon Jae-in's state visits to Austria and Spain... we'll definitely find out more on where and how the world in the post-pandemic era is headed. \nDr. Michael Reiterer from Vienna, Dr. Stephen Noerper joining us from Hawaii and Dr. John Nilsson-Wright from London for this evening.

What deliverables do we expect from the joint communique?\n\n President Joe Biden is reported to have extended his support to the Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, for hosting the 2020 Tokyo Olympics amidst the raging Covid pandemic... and so has the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. What is the general feeling among leaders there at the G7 summit?

        "artcl_ctt": "Leaders of the Group of Seven wrapped up their three-day summit in the south of England. Pledging to promote Open Societies, they signed a joint communique which promises to provide 1 billion doses of COVID-vaccines to developing countries and strengthen climate action, as well as calling out China for its human rights issues and curbing its influence around the world. \nAll of this appears to state that the West is back, or at least building back, a world based on shared democratic values.\nThe pledges are now committed to paper but will the words lead to action? \nWe discuss the significance of this meeting, and what it means for South Korea, which was one of the four guest nations invited to the summit.\nTo get some insights on this we turn to Kim Jae-chun, Professor at Sogang University Graduate School of International Studies, and John Nilsson-Wright, Senior Fellow at the Chatham House and Senior Lecturer of Modern Japanese Studies at the University of Cambridge.\n\nProfessor Kim: The G7 has been criticised for losing its effectiveness in recent years, and the pandemic has only proved how western countries are struggling to unite. Do you think they were able to prove their solidarity? Did any of the agreements made strike you as significant?\n\nDr. Nilsson-Wright: The G7 communique has already drawn criticism that their measures aren't enough to provide the 11 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines needed around the world, as well as on climate action. But given the lack of coordination we saw from these countries last year, is the summit still meaningful?\n\nProfessor Kim: G7 leaders managed to produce a joint stance on China, not only calling it out over its aggressive behaviour but also adopting the Build Back Better World plan to rival China's Belt and Road Initiative. How determined is Pres. Joe Biden on pushing this through, and does this mean U.S.-China tensions will worsen in the foreseeable future?\n\nDr. Nilsson-Wright:  There seemed to be some hesitation from a number of European countries. Will they all be on board with the Build Back Better World plan?\n\nProfessor Kim:  Seoul has been tiptoeing around the issue of countering China, which was arguably the unofficial theme of the summit. What does the outcome mean for South Korea? How should it adapt to the changing dynamics?\n\nProfessor Kim: What did this meeting mean for South Korea? In the past, you've raised the need for Seoul to not only widen but deepen its partnership with Western countries. In what ways can it build on this G7 momentum and play a bigger role in building back better?\n\nDr. Nilsson-Wright: What was South Korea's role at the summit? In what ways can it build on this G7 momentum and play a bigger role in building back better?\n\nProfessor Kim:  South Korea wanted to have a bilateral summit with Japan on the sidelines of the meeting, but Tokyo has shown reluctance. Why do you think this is? \n\nThat was Kim Jae-chun, Professor at Sogang University Graduate School of International Studies, and John Nilsson-Wright, Senior Fellow at the Chatham House and Senior Lecturer of Modern Japanese Studies at the University of Cambridge.\n(Seoul)- \ub179\ud654\n\n(Cambridge, UK)",

That includes 100 million from the UK to the world's poorest countries, which is another, another big step towards vaccinating the world.\"\n\n On global economy,... the world's seven most advanced economies agreed to advance recovery plans, building on the 12 trillion U.S. dollars of support that they have put in place during the pandemic.\nDuring this process,... they stressed, no place or person, regardless of age, ethnicity or gender, shall be left behind.\nClimate change was also an important topic of discussion for the G7 leaders,... who vowed to increase their climate finance contributions to meet an overdue spending pledge of 1-hundred billion dollars a year to help poorer nations around the world.\nIn securing future prosperity,... the communique also highlighted that the G7 champions freer and fairer trade within a reformed trading system as well as a fairer global tax system. \n Lastly, in an effort to counter China's growing influence,... the G7 leaders also signaled a desire to build a rival to China's multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative.\nThey shared the same view that in some issues, including the tackling of climate change, for example,... China needs to be part of the conversation.\n But, they agreed in many other areas,... like on economy and trade,... that the G7 is in a more competitive position with Beijing,... as well as issues like human rights,... which the communique highlights needs to be harnessed globally, together with other values like democracy, freedom and the rule of law.\nKim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.",

Mommy. Brother.\u201d\n\nHowever,... her youngest child has been slow to speak,... especially when compared to his older sibling.\n\nHWANG Ji-hee, Mother\n\nWe\u2019ve been avoiding crowded places due to COVID-19 and have spent much of our days at home. There\u2019s not a lot we can do indoors to keep him engaged, so I often found myself giving him my smartphone. He\u2019s been watching a lot of videos on YouTube, but he doesn\u2019t know how to say any words aside from mommy and daddy. I\u2019m worried that he\u2019s become slow to learn how to speak. \n\nFace masks are affecting children\u2019s language development\n\nMany other parents are echoing the same concern,... and a recent survey has shown that more than 7 out of 10 daycare instructors in Korea... are reporting delayed speech and other language development issues in children,... with face masks being the main culprit.   \n The World without worries about shadow education\n\nYANG Shin-young, Senior Research Fellow / World Without Worries About Shadow Education\n\nChildren pick up languages not only through sound, but also by observing lip movements, which can\u2019t be seen when you\u2019re wearing a face mask, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing these speech delays. They\u2019ve are also finding it more difficult to socialize, because of the lack of non-verbal cues like facial expressions.\n \nLip movements are key to a child\u2019s language development\n\nMany experts from across the globe... also agree that face masks... may be obstructing a child\u2019s ability to pick up important language skills. According to one expert in the US,... infants begin to read people\u2019s lips at around 8 months old,... a time which could be pivotal... in their future language development.\n\nDr. David J. LEWKOWICZ, Senior Scientist / Yale Child Study Center\n\neight months of age, babies begin to become really interested in people\u2019s lips when they\u2019re talking to them so they begin to lip read. And they do that at the same time they start to babble.\nwhen babies are not given access to the bottom half of another social partner\u2019s face, they\u2019re probably going to be missing some of that in terms of their development. \nA number of studies that have looked at this have found that those babies that lip read by eight to ten months of age for example, by the time they\u2019re eighteen months of age, when they begin to produce their first words\u2026those who lip read more turn out to have better language skills. \n\nMasks can also affect social and emotional development\n\nFacial expressions have been replaced by \nbody language and verbal communication\n\nThe wearing of face masks has created a serious communications gap,... forcing many instructors to use exaggerated body languages when teaching their pupils. \n\nPARK Min-joo, Daycare Instructor\n\nIt\u2019s become more difficult to make use of facial expressions, because the wearing a mask already obscures half of our faces. So, we\u2019re teaching our children to rely more on body language and verbal cues to better express themselves. We also use our eyebrows a lot and their movements are exaggerated, whether they\u2019re raised or furrowed, to express emotions like sadness and anger.\n\nThe pandemic has also led to stunted physical development,... due to the lack of outdoor activities,... while many children are exhibiting signs of higher stress, anxiety,... and difficulty socializing with their instructors and peers.\n\nPARK Min-joo, Daycare Instructor\n\nBefore the pandemic, we didn\u2019t see this many children who found it difficult to communicate with their peers and develop social skills. Now, we can see that it\u2019s a clear challenge for the children to effectively  communicate, especially with those from other classes and groups, and they\u2019re notably awkward and shy when they\u2019re around one another.\n\nChildren now need more time to create family bonds\n\nExperts recommend... that children spend extra time bonding with their family members... within the household,... to address these new challenges. \n\nMore support needed for children with development issues\n\nA long-term care strategy is also needed... to help children... who have already suffered impairments in their normal development.\n\nYANG Shin-young, Senior Research Fellow / World Without Worries About Shadow Education\n \nChildren may have already seen their development held back by as many as three years. Children who are six-years-old right now will be entering elementary school in a year or two, and we must modify our curriculums to make sure they don\u2019t fall behind, in light of these challenges in their development. The government will need to be extra cautious in how they provide care and management for these children.\n\nMore research and public awareness will be needed... to tackle the long-term effects of learning challenges in children... brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These are AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Covishield. \nHowever, Sputnik V is not included. \nApplications cannot be made until at least two weeks after vaccination. \n\nHow to apply for the exemption?\nTravelers are required to submit applications including a proof of vaccination and family relations.\nApplications must be made at least seven days before departure. \n\nWhich countries are not included in the quarantine exemption?\nPeople traveling from countries with major outbreaks or mutations will not be allowed to skip the quarantine. \nAs of Monday, travelers from South Africa, Brazil, and 11 other countries, mainly in southern Africa and South America, will still need to quarantine for two weeks.\nAll travelers, including those with the exemption, will need at least three Covid tests: 72 hours before departure, on the day of arrival, and 7 days after arrival. \nChoi Won-jong, Arirang News.",

These are AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Covishield. \nHowever, Sputnik V is not included. \nApplications cannot be made until at least two weeks after vaccination. \n\nHow to apply for the exemption?\nTravelers are required to submit applications including a proof of vaccination and family relations.\nApplications must be made at least seven days before departure. \n\nWhich countries are not included in the quarantine exemption?\nPeople traveling from countries with major outbreaks or mutations will not be allowed to skip the quarantine. \nAs of Monday, travelers from South Africa, Brazil, and 11 other countries, mainly in southern Africa and South America, will still need to quarantine for two weeks.\nAll travelers, including those with the exemption, will need at least three Covid tests: 72 hours before departure, on the day of arrival, and 7 days after arrival. \nChoi Won-jong, Arirang News.",

President Moon Jae-in shared South Korea's experiences in handling the virus during a phone call with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.\nDespite the pandemic,... the two countries' economic ties have gotten only stronger.\nThe total trade volume between the two in 2020 amounted to almost 2-point-7 billion U.S. dollars,... up 11 percent on-year.\nSouth Korea's exports to Austria last year jumped 23 percent,... on the back of strong performances in computers, electric vehicles and semiconductors. \nCulture is another field where the two countries have a strong bond. \nThe most symbolic event is the Austrian-Korean Philharmonic Orchestra.\nEvery year in Vienna, young Korean and Austrian musicians perform together.\nEstablished to strengthen cultural exchanges between the two,... the orchestra is a gateway for South Korean musicians to showcase their talents. \nBased on the first presidential visit by Moon Jae-in,... the ties between the two countries are expected to expand further into other areas,... including science and technology.\nKim Sung-min, Arirang News",

Thanks for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Last Friday, stocks in New York continued their rally as inflation numbers came out for May at the highest they've been since 2008. The S&P hitting record highs for two sessions in a row. What's the story in the global markets as we start a new week? \n\n\n\n \n\n Against the backdrop of this spike in inflation, everyone is watching to see what the Fed says this month. Here in Korea, not a real clear direction in the markets. Retail investors were net buyers today, though. Tell us about the local markets.\n\n \n\n\n\n To look at precious metals for a minute, gold has seen a big rise the past couple of years, but the price of palladium has risen even more. That's a metal that's talked about a lot less, but some say it could surge even farther ahead of gold. What do you see happening with precious metals?\n\n \n\n\n\n In Korea, with vaccines taking off, the restrictions are slowly being eased. From today, there will be pop music concerts again. That could be a optimistic sign for the economy, but what else is on your radar for the economy this week?",

We are now just 39 days away from the Tokyo Games, organizers have reiterated that they will not be postponed or canceled. \nNow, though, the G7 nations say they support holding the Olympics this summer. \nWhat can you tell us?\n\nThat's right. At the G7 Summit in the UK over this past weekend, a statement was released to say exactly that. \nIt said that Group of Seven nations \"reiterates their support for the holding of the Olympics and Paralympic Games in a safe and secure manner... as a symbol of global unity in overcoming COVID-19.\"\nThis after U.S. President Joe Biden during a sideline meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Suga on Saturday said that he supports the Olympics.\nHe also expressed pride in the U.S. athletes who have trained for the Tokyo Games to \u201ccompete in the best traditions of the Olympic spirit.\u201d\n\nMoving onto football now, Euro 2020 kicked off on Friday but the opening weekend was overshadowed by what happened to Denmark's Christian Eriksen. \nWhat's the latest on his condition?\n\nDenmark midfielder Christian Eriksen collapsed on Saturday in the 42nd minute of his team\u2019s Euro 2020 match with Finland.\nHe suffered a cardiac arrest and was given CPR on the pitch before being rushed to hospital.\nOfficials say he is awake and in stable condition.\nThe game resumed one hour and 45 minutes later with Finland going on to win 1-0.\nMessages of support have continued to pour out since the incident.\nAnd Inter Milan teammate Romelu Lukaku dedicated his goal and Belgium\u2019s win over Russia to Erikson.\nEuro 2020 got underway on Friday, a year later than initially planned due to the pandemic.\nThere are fans in the stands, albeit with limited attendances across the 11 stadiums in 11 different host nations.\nThe tournament will run until 11th July, ending with the final at Wembley in London.\n\nWell, fingers crossed Eriksen makes a full recovery.\nSticking with football, the South Korean national team has taken one step closer to qualifying for next year's World Cup. \nHow did they get this far?\n\nWell, a 2-1 win over Lebanon on Sunday made it three wins from three this month\u2026 enough to put Korea into the next round of World Cup qualifying.\nKorea beat Turkmenistan 5-0 on Saturday June 4th, then beat Sri Lanka by the same score line last Wednesday\u2026 a victory which was dedicated to football legend Yoo Sang-chul who passed away last Monday.\nThen on Sunday, earned the 2-1 comeback win over Lebanon.\nSon Heung-min scored the winner from the penalty spot in the 66th minute.\nIn his celebration Son held up two and three fingers for former teammate Eriksen\u2019s squad number, 23, and said into the camera \u201cstay strong Chris, I love you.\u201d\nIn other news, the Olympic team beat Ghana U23s 3-1 in a friendly on Saturday.\nThe two teams meet again on Wednesday.\n\nAnd finally, to tennis and the French Open where there was a victory for an unseeded player?\n\nUnseeded Czech Barbora Krejcikova claimed a first Grand Slam title thanks to Saturday\u2019s French Open win.\nIt has been a rapid rise for Krejcikova who beat Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchen-kova 6-1, 2-6, 6-4 in only her fifth major singles draw appearance.\nIn the men\u2019s game, Novak Djokovic came back from two sets down to beat Stefanos (sit-see-pass)Tsitsipas of Greece... 6-8, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.\nIt was Djokovic\u2019s 19th Grand Slam, and is now just one behind Federer and Nadal.\n\nKrejcikova also won the women\u2019s doubles on Saturday too, so a great weekend for her.\nOkay, Paul thank-you for that. We will see you next week.",

NEXT YEAR.\nFor more... I have Kim Dami... here in the studio.\nWelcome... Dami.\n\n Good afternoon, Sunhee.\n\n I understand... there was quite a bit of MEDIA ATTENTION... in Austria... ON... Korea's COVID-19 strategy?\n\n That's right, Sunhee.\nDuring his state visit to Austria,... President Moon shared Korea's experience in tackling the virus,... with the members of the gathered press. \nLet's take a listen.\n\n(GERMAN - \uc5ec) YTN 2021.06.15. \uc624\uc804 1:50\n \"Korea is a world leader in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. What can Austria learn from Korea?\" \n\n Austria's Chancellor... Sebastian Kurz (\uc138\ubc14\uc2a4\uce58\uc548 \ucee4\uc988),... also took the opportunity to praise Korea's effective use of technology and data... to keep the coronavirus under control. \n\n(GERMAN - \ub0a8) YTN 2021.06.15. \uc624\uc804 1:50\n \"Korea's application of technology and information far exceeds... what countries in  Europe thought was possible.\"\n\n President Moon also highlighted the importance... of trusting science and deferring to the experts,... while setting aside political considerations... when it comes to prevention and vaccinations. \nMoon credited the nation's people... for their voluntary participation in containment efforts,... like their compliance to mask-wearing rules. \n He also called for the further use... of information technology to fight the pandemic,... while also adopting data privacy regulations at the same time.\n\n I believe... he ALSO... VOICED... Seoul's HOPES... to SHARE... COVID-19 vaccines... with Pyeongyang?\n\n Right. President Moon said... the country is working to donate vaccines to North Korea... if the regime agrees.\nLet's take a listen.\n\n \"If South Korea can take on the role of a global vaccine production hub, North Korea could also be a partner for cooperation. With North Korea's consent, we will push forward a plan to supply them with vaccines.\"\n\n Moon added that the U.S. is also backing humanitarian aid efforts... for North Korea.\nThe South Korean leader said... the only way for the world to overcome the pandemic,... is to distribute vaccines equally... to developing and under-developed countries.\nThe Austrian leader expressed his country's willingness to help... if the North signals that it's willing to receive aid.\n\n I see.\nMeanwhile... here... on the domestic front.\nKorea's GOAL of OFFERING... at least... ONE DOSE... of the COVID-19 VACCINE... to 13-MILLION people... WITHIN... the FIRST HALF of 2021... MAY... be SECURED... SOONER... than... EXPECTED?\n\n That's right, Sunhee. \nKorea is so close to reaching that 13 million mark,... and it might happen on this Tuesday in fact.\nIf we do pass that milestone this week,... that would put us two weeks ahead of schedule... in our vaccination timeline.\n\n(KOREAN - \ub0a8) \ud654\uc694\uc77c \uc911\ub300\ubcf8 \n \"Around 12-and-a-half million people have gotten their first doses as of Tuesday. They represent a quarter of our entire population,... and that figure is likely to top 13 million... either sometime today... or tomorrow at the latest.\"\n\n The country's inoculation program... is expected to pick up even more steam... as it begins to vaccinate people in younger age brackets. \nStarting this week,... medical workers under 30 at tier-one hospitals... will get the Moderna shots,... which arrived in Korea earlier this month.\nAlso,... people aged 75 or above will get their second Pfizer shots... over the next three weeks.\n\n AND... finally... do tell us... a bit... about the PROTOCOLS... that... PERMIT... AN EXEMPTION... from the MANDATORY SELF-ISOLATION PERIOD... upon... arrival... from overseas.\n\n Travelers are required to submit documents... including proof of vaccination and certificate of family relations.\nApplications must be sent... at least seven days before departure. \nTravelers must be fully-vaccinated... and if they received two doses,... they must have been administered in the same country. \nThe exemption will apply to Korean citizens or foreigners... who are visting to see their spouses, parents or children,... but siblings and distant family members do not apply.\nThose who are traveling... on important business purposes or state functions... will also be exempt. \n  Now... as of Monday,... travelers from Brazil, South Africa and eleven other countries,... will still need to be in two-week quarantine,... due to concerns over variants. \nALL travelers,... even those exempt,... will need to test negative for COVID-19 three times,... 72 hours prior to departure,... on the day of arrival,... and 7 days after arrival. \n\n Right... Dami... thank you... for that coverage.\n\n My pleasure.",

After more than a year of darkness,... theaters on the West End reopened in May,... and many shows on broadway slated to return in September... after an 18-month hiatus. \n\nWhat about the performing arts scene here in Korea? \n\nThe number of theatrical productions in Korea... has fell around 35 percent on-year,... with revenues being cut nearly in half... over the same period. \n\nNevertheless,... some theaters managed to continue holding live stage performances,... with rigorous prevention rules in place. Aid measures rolled out by the government,... also handed a lifeline to the performing arts industry... in their desperate bid to survive. \n\nHWANG Doo-jin, Dean / School of Performance, Seoul Institute of the Arts \nThere is a welfare foundation for artists in the performance arts industry. It provideed financial support for creative projects, as well as separate aid measures for performers and creators on all government levels. Small sums were also provided on an individual basis to the artists by cultural foundations.\n\nAlthough managing to avoid a complete shutdown,... the performing arts industry is continuing to struggle,... under the weight of social distancing restrictions,... one of which only allows venues to fill their seats to 70 percent of their capacity,... which even then... rarely, if ever sell out. But these challenges... have done little to deter the passion of the artists here... driven by the opportunity... to continue doing what they love... no matter the sacrifice.\n\nDaehak-ro \nJongno-gu District, Seoul \n\nDaehak-ro is Korea\u2019s Broadway,... and it used to be filled with crowds of people... looking to enjoy a night out at the theater. Here, a few shows have survived... including one on the subject of COVID-19.\n\nActors and actresses are rehearsing for a play about a man who contracts the coronavirus. It is Korea\u2019s first-ever theater production on the subject of the pandemic,... depicting the story of a man... which begins after he is hospitalized for COVID-19,... and is sent to an isolation ward.\n\nSOV> Mom! Dad! Please don\u2019t be scared. I tested positive for COVID-19!  \nSOV> A lot of people around me have all been infected. \n\n15 actors from the theater production 'Jjambbong' test positive for COVID-19\n\nThis production is based on a true story... of the theater troupe behind it,...  which had 15 of its members test positive for COVID-19... following a mass outbreak in August of last year.  \n\n'Suddenly One Day' (Theater Production) \n\nA story of joy and comfort \nin the midst a sudden tragedy\n\nJUNG Su-han, Actor / Theater Production \u2018San\u2019 \nSome of my colleagues contracted COVID-19, while others like myself tested negative and had to stay in quarantine. I spent two weeks inside my room, and I felt bad for my family members as well. We started this play in the hopes that it could help us endure and overcome the challenges we\u2019re facing.\n\nYOON Jeong-hwan, Writer and Director \nWe are trying to encourage ourselves to beat the pandemic, and we also hope that our audience members can learn to let go of their fears. We can beat the coronavirus, and we can all do it together. \n\n'Sunshine of May' (Theater Production)  \nActors are taking to the stage... here at another theater in Daehakro,... ,with strict disease prevention protocols in place.\n\nSOHN In-chan, Actor / Theater Production \u2018Mijiae Theater\u2019 \nWe want to have as many people in the audience as possible, because they can liven up the entire theater. We worked hard to prepare for this, and we want to make sure that our audience can enjoy a quality performance. This is what we live for, but unfortunately, we can\u2019t do that at the moment and that makes us sad.\n\nSo,... what is it about the performing arts,... which continues to attract visitors... despite the strict rules and other inconveniences... that have become the norm at theater venues? \n \nKIM Ji-hyun, Audience Member \n\"I can concentrate solely on the show while I\u2019m here, and leave behind all my worries about daily life and school.\u201c\n\nJI Hye-won, Professor of Arts and Culture / Kyung Hee University \nThe performing arts not only depend on local audiences, but also international visitors as well, which requires free movement. For this, the tourism industry needs to be revived, along with many other requirements. None of this is expected to happen overnight. Although it may take some time, as long as the industry continues to use its dedication and passion to make unyielding efforts, I believe audiences will one day have the opportunity to enjoy live performances as they once did.\n\nHWANG Doo-jin, Dean of School of Performance / Seoul Institute of the Arts \nWe\u2019re hoping that the wider distribution of vaccines could help the industry return to its pre-pandemic state. I hope that by next year, with the lifting of the attendance cap, we\u2019ll see the emergence of new shows in a hybrid format, that combine offline and online performances. \n\nArt is a reflection of our reality,... and the artists here are carrying with them a message... that express our collective yearning for a better tomorrow... after the pandemic.",

South Korea is outpacing much of the world in vaccination rates.\nSouth Korean health authorities reported that by Tuesday afternoon, more than 13 million people had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n(Korean-\ub0a8) \n \"Today as of 2:30 p.m., the number of people who have received the first round of vaccinations has surpassed 13 million.

Thanks for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n It's not the day before this month's meeting of the Fed's Open Markets Committee. Reports say that Fed chair Jerome Powell is likely to hold to his prediction of rates staying super low until 2023. But there's also a lot of anxiety out there with inflation as high as it is. What do you see happening this week at the Fed?\n\n \n\n\n\n On Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed at another all-time high, up almost two tenths of a percent. The Nasdaq did even better with a gain of three quarters of a percent. The Dow was off slightly. With all the uncertainty out there, what's happening in the global markets?\n\n \n\n\n\n Here in Korea, the markets were a little more subdued -- a small gain on the KOSPI for a fourth session in a row. The KOSDAQ unchanged. Tell us about the local market.\n\n \n\n\n\n Finally, Bitcoin up quite a bit now from its recent lows, back to 40-thousand dollars. Again, much of that because of tweets from Elon Musk, talking about Tesla maybe accepting bitcoin as payment again in the future. What do you see happening with cryptocurrencies?",

What are your prospects for South Korea's goal in expanding global vaccine supply, and how can Seoul and Vienna further boost cooperation in the world's fight against covid?\n\n President Moon, during his talks with Chancellor Kurz, thanked Austria's support for his Korea Peace Initiative and urged continual cooperation. While many questions and uncertainties remain on the issue of North Korea's denuclearization, how is Austria observing the changing regional dynamics surrounding the Korean Peninsula?\n\n Heinz Gartner at the Austrian Institute for International Affairs... joining us live from Vienna.

When asked about vaccine effects thus far, the KDCA said the number of covid deaths and critically ill patients are on a decline. What's your assessment?\n\n President Moon held a virtual meeting with German pharmaceutical giant CureVac's CEO, Franz-Werner Hass and the two agreed to form a new vaccine partnership. CureVac is developing the world's third mRNA vaccine following America's Pfizer and Moderna. What specific areas of cooperation are expected?\n\n The Delta variant first found in India is spreading at a frightening speed battering over 70 countries now. Among the 226 new infections of key variants found over the past week here in Korea, 30 were indentified as the Delta variants while roughly 10-percent of infections in the US are linked to the variant, according to former U.S. FDA chief Scott Gottlieb.\nHow do you see the threat of the Delta variant to South Korea and the world? \n\n The WSJ has reported, citing British health authorities, that two shots of covid vaccines showed significant protection against the Delta variant with two Pfizer shots showing 96% efficacy against hospitalization and AstraZeneca shots, 92-percent. What are the implications? Could we hope for similar efficacy against other key variants as well?\n\n In related question, does the report tell us anything about the efficacy of one-shot Janssen vaccine? There was an explosive demand for U.S.-provided Janssen vaccine here in Korea with reservations closing in just 18 hours. \n\n Novavax, meanwhile has announced its vaccine showed over 90-percent overall efficacy in a phase 3 trial... providing 100-percent protection against developing moderate or severe disease and 93-percent efficacy against new variants of concern. South Korea will bring in up to 20 million doses of Novavax in the third quarter, while SK Bioscience has also signed manufacturing deal with the American firm. What are your prospects for Novavax vaccine and its production in Korea?\n\n The KDCA will announce new set of distancing rules this Sunday, and it's widely expected that the new system will allow private gatherings of up to six people. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n Dr. Alice Tan, Arirang Newscenter's go-to medical expert - thank you as always for your insights. We appreciate it.",

We're here because the discussions among the related parties are ongoing. But for the past six months, the talks haven't gone anywhere and the things they agreed to have not been implemented.\"\n\n As large gatherings of people this size is against the distancing rules... the police tried to stop them, and even told them to disperse a few times.\nBut that didn't stop them, and despite a few physical confrontations,... the speakers did make it to the stage.\n\n(Stand-up ed: Steve)\n \"The workers plan on protesting here overnight as the discussions between the three parties are set to continue until Wednesday.\nThe goal is to have an agreement by then, which will hopefully end the strike and get delivery services back to normal.\nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News.\"",

South Korea is also actively seeking \"Korean-version of New Deal' with a focus on digital and green new deal policies. How does Portugal's recovery plan align with South Korea's New Deal policy, and how can the two nations cooperate to achieve respective goals?\n\n This year marks the 60th anniversary since the establishment of South Korea-Portugal ties. What's your assessment of the current bilateral cooperation by sectors? What areas need further strengthening of cooperation?\n\n Eurico Brilhante Dias, Secretary of State for Internationalization of Portugal, many thanks for speaking with us tonight.",

But that isn't the full picture. The rebound is set to be sharply uneven across the globe. Major economies are expected to see strong growth, on the back of fast vaccinations, highly digitalised economies and massive investment plans. But developing countries, without any of these factors are faring weaker than before, at below pre-pandemic levels,. For them, building back better is an unaffordable luxury. For more on this and how to ensure more equal recovery across the globe, we connect with David Wilson, Program Director and Team Leader of COVID-19 and Health Security at the World Bank.\n\n1. G7 leaders on Sunday pledged to donate 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries, but many have criticised this as simply not being enough. What is your view?\n \n\n2. According to Oxfam, low-income countries are vaccinating at a rate of 62,772 people per day. At that rate it will take them nearly six decades to vaccinate their entire populations. How does the rate of vaccinations affect the pace of economic recovery in developing countries?\n\n\n3. How hard have developing economies been hit by COVID-19, on their path to sustainable development? Which sectors of developing economies have suffered the most due to the pandemic?\n\n\n4. There's been a lot of debate over how to get people in developing countries vaccinated as quickly as possible. The U.S. wants to waiver patents but some European countries say that's not going to solve the problem. What's your view?\n\n\n\n5.Per capita income in many emerging markets and developing economies is also expected to remain below pre-pandemic levels, and losses are anticipated to worsen deprivations associated with health, education and living standards. \nWhat kind of support do countries need to build back better? How has the World Bank been helping them stabilize their situation?\n\n\n6. What immediate actions should countries around the world take to make sure that vaccine access is equitable, and that developing nations do not fall even further behind in recovery?\n\nThat was David Wilson, Program Director and Team Leader of COVID-19 and Health Security at the World Bank. Thank you for your time.\n\n\n(Washington, D.C.)",

        "artcl_ctt": "NOW... for more... LOCAL COVERAGE... INCLUDING... DETAILS... from Tuesday's afternoon briefing... I have Jee Abbey LEE... here... in the studio.\nWelcome... Jee.\n\nJEE: Hi Sunhee. \nSeoul didn\u2019t start the nationwide vaccination process as early as... say the United States or Israel. But since the campaign began a few months ago,... it\u2019s been happening at lightning speed.\n Thanks to that effort,... the number of COVID-19 cases among Koreans over the age of SEVENTY FIVE has plummeted.  The vaccination rate for THAT age group... is now at a whopping NINETY PERCENT,... thanks to the Korean government prioritizing vaccinations for the elderly. This has also led to a decrease in the overall fatality rate.\n\n Compared to the last week of December,... the infection rate in the second week of June... has plunged from SIXTEEN to TWO... for every ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND people. \nLet\u2019s hear from a top K-D-C-A official,... who presided over the Tuesday briefing: \n\n \u201cWe are seeing a clear decline in new infections... due to a higher vaccination rate among citizens aged 75 and above,... and this shows that the vaccine is working.\" \n\n That's ENCOURAGING... to KNOW.\nMeanwhile... on a worrying note... there has been a growing number of cluster infections... at cram schools?\n\n JEE: We certainly have, Sunhee. \nThe regular briefing also touched upon the issue of continuing outbreaks at Hagwons,\u2026 as private learning institutions are called in Korea. Let's hear from the K-D-C-A director again.\n\n \u201cA total of 50 cluster infections have been reported at cram schools since January, accounting for just over a thousand cases. We speculate that these transmissions were fueled by the enclosed environment at these venues.\"\n\n A cluster infection at a Hagwon in Gimpo,... a small city west of Seoul,... was confirmed TUESDAY\u2026 leading to ONE HUNDREDY NINETY cases. \n\nThe K-D-C-A simulation of air diffusion in that specific building shows\u2026 small droplets from an infected person's nose or mouth EASILY spreading to the entire area within THIRTY SECONDS. \nTHIS is why the agency emphasised the TRIFECTA of COVID-19 prevention. \nMASKS, HAND SANITIZERS, AND VENTILATION.\nThe K-D-C-A director said\u2026 it\u2019s crucial to open all windows and doors FULLY... for at least TEN minutes in between classes... in addition to running circulation fans equipped in buildings. \n \n NOW... that GOES...  to SHOW... HOW... SIMPLE... PRACTICES... go a LONG WAY... to LIMITING TRANSMISSIONS.\nOne final question.\nWhat is the LATEST... with regard... to VARIANTS?\n\n Jee: As I mentioned last week, the Korean government is analysing the new variants... at a much higher rate than its counterparts in the rest of the world. \n In the past week,... it conducted genome analysis on SIXTEEN-point-FIVE percent of the new variant cases found in the country. \nA total of SIX HUNDRED THIRTY ONE infections were analyzed over a seven-day period last week,... and TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX were identified as variant cases... or THIRTY SIX percent of the total.\n Among the newly confirmed cases,... the ALPHA variant is still the most prevalent... with ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO cases. \nTHE DELTA variant is the second most common... with THIRTY CASES. And THIS is the variant... people around the world are most worried about.\n\n \u201cThe Delta variant spreads extremely fast. In the UK for example,... it could become the most dominant coronavirus strain in that country... in just two-to-three-weeks time. That is why we need to proactively monitor this variant.\"\n\n The silver lining here is that the vaccines are EFFECTIVE against EVEN the new Delta variant,... ONCE THE SECOND INOCULATION IS COMPLETE. \nThe first jab alone is not enough,... but once two doses are given,... vaccines become SIXTY to EIGHTY EIGHT percent effective. The vaccines also lowered the rate of serious illnesses that require hospitalization... by up to NINETY SIX percent. \nThat\u2019s all from me today.",

Korea has reached its first-half vaccination goal yesterday,... and the process is expected to get even faster?\n\n The government's goal of vaccinating more than 13 million people with at least one dose,... was achieved Tuesday afternoon,... and as of 12 a.m. this Wednesday,... the number stands at 13.2 million,... which is 25.7 percent of the country's population.\n1st Dose total: 13,219,207 (+617,181)\nFully Vaccinated: 3,472,376 (+207,339) \n\n As Sunny said,... vaccinations are likely to speed up even more,... with the government set to announce its third-quarter inoculation plan on Thursday,... which is expected to include people aged 18 to 59,... and those in the fifties likely to be among the first ones to get vaccinated. Meanwhile,... the Janssen vaccination for military-affiliated people is wrapping up this Wednesday. \n\n Along with progress on the vaccination front,... citizens can look forward to relaxed social distancing measures,... as early as July 5th. To be on the safe side though,... officials are planning a transition period of three weeks... before the system takes full effect. \n\n That would be from the first Monday of July until the 25th. Under that plan,\u2026 private gatherings in the metropolitan region would be allowed for up to 6 people... from the current 4,\u2026 so not a sudden shift to 8.  Outside the capital area,... the limit is to be set for 8,... before restrictions on private gatherings will be lifted altogether. Also,... nigtlife entertainment venues that currently are suspended,... are expected to be allowed to open until 10 p.m.,... not midnight,... as is predicted to be eventually the case with the revised social distancing scheme. Authorities have high expectations for the new measures,... but also remain cautious. \n\n(Korean)\n \u201cThird-quarter vaccinations and a revised social distancing system will bring us a step closer to returning to our daily lives. But, we must not lower our guards. In the UK, more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s population have been vaccinated with at least one dose, but it has extended its lockdown for another month, due to the fast spread of variant cases.\"\n\n Where lockdowns are no more... is in California,... which is has lifted almost all of its remaining virus restrictions... Tuesday local time... as part of its full reopening of the state's economy.

Do-yeon, that's great. \nNow, this is a step that the government is taking as the nation braces itself for a massive change in social distancing scheme. \nWhat can you tell us about that?\n\n That's right Conn-young... the government says there will be a new social distancing scheme introduced... revamped with a different level system. \nHere's what Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said earlier today.\n\n(Korean - \ub0a8) \n \"This Sunday, the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters will announce the new distancing rules which will take effect from July. As we expect them to bring big changes to daily lives and prevention practices, we wish to give all citizens enough time to prepare.\"\n\uc774\ubc88 \uc77c\uc694\uc77c \uc911\ub300\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 7\uc6d4\ubd80\ud130 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac70\ub9ac\ub450\uae30 \uac1c\ud3b8\uc548\uc744 \ud655\uc815 \ubc1c\ud45c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubc88 \uac1c\ud3b8\uc740 \ubc29\uc5ed\uacfc \uc77c\uc0c1, \ud070 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc62c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \ub9cc\ud07c \uad6d\ubbfc \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uac8c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc815\ube44 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub4dc\ub9ac\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n As the Prime Minister mentions, there will be an easing-in period.\nAccording to local reports, here is what's going to happen in July for three weeks before the new model takes full effect.\nIn the Seoul capital area, the maximum number of people for gatherings will be raised to six from the current four... on-site services will be allowed until midnight... and bars and clubs are only allowed to open until ten at night. \n For the rest of the country... during the same three-week period, the maximum number of people allowed for gatherings will be eight, but once the new scheme comes into effect... it's expected that these restrictions will be lifted completely. \nAgain, at the moment... this is just what's expected to happen.\nAn official announcement from the government will be made this Sunday, the 20th of June.\nBack to you, Conn-young.",

South Korean exchanges are increasingly weeding out their trading lists.\nThey are temporaily halting or even completely ending the trading of certain high-risk minor coins. \nAs of Wednesday... eleven out of the twenty exchanges that have received the Information Security Management System certificate needed to be allowed to operate,... have either halted trading of some coins or released a list of coins that customers should be cautious of.\nLeading the trend is Korea's Upbit, which has decided to delist five coins-- Paycoin, Maro, Observer, Solve.Care and Quiztok -- from the exchange from Friday noon while putting 25 coins on its warning list.\nWhile suspending trading of coins is quite common,... industry watchers assume that the current trend comes in order to meet conditions for the government's regulatory approval.\nLast month, the government officially designated the Financial Services Commission... as the agency responsible for supervising and regulating the cryptocurrency market.\nNow to operate as a legal trading platform,... exchanges in Korea are required by September 24th to open real-name bank accounts for customers by partnering with local banks.\nThe exchanges' moves to comply with these regulations however has created a market frenzy.\nThe prices of all five coins that Upbit announced it would halt trading saw a sharp drop,... Quiztok falling almost 68 percent.\nExperts warn that this could cause confusion in the market as such actions are taken based on the exchanges' own standards,... especially when the same coins can be still traded on other exchanges. \nThe Financial Supervisory Service on Monday emailed the exchanges,... asking them to provide a list of the coins being halted or put on a warning list, and could strengthen regulations even further.\nKim Sung-min, Arirang News",

Tell us more about how a travel bubble works... and what South Korea is planning.\n\n Well, a travel bubble is an exclusive travel partnership that allows people to travel freely without undergoing quarantine.\nThe deal is usually between two or more countries that have achieved considerable success in containing and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSouth Korea is planning to create a travel bubble agreement with a few countries as early as next month.\nCountries top on the list include Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the U.S. territories of Guam and Saipan... which are all considered to be relatively safe to visit. \nFor now, only group tours will be permitted for those fully vaccinated and travel will be restricted to direct flights. \n\n(KOR-\ub0a8\uc790) \uc724\ud0dc\ud638 \uc911\uc559\uc7ac\ub09c\uc548\uc804\ub300\ucc45\ubcf8\ubd80 \ube0c\ub9ac\ud551 (\uc790\ub8cc\ud654\uba74 6\uc6d4 09\uc77c) June 9\n\"Travelers must stay in the 'travel bubble' country for 14 days prior to departure. They must take a direct flight to enter the country and upon arrival must present their vaccination certificate. Only those who test negative after a PCR test will then be exempt from quarantine.\"\n\nFurther details of the plan, such as specific dates, quarantine guidelines and proof of vaccination will be made in the coming weeks. \n\n A big point you mentioned... is that the travel bubble or bubbles mentioned by the government last week would be limited to group tours.\nBut what about people who've been vaccinated and want to travel on their own? Can they do that?\n\n Technically, yes. There are in fact many places that allow fully vaccinated people to enter without a 14-day quarantine on arrival.\nThese include Guam and Saipan, two most popular tourist destinations for South Koreans.\n Jeju Air has already resumed its flights to Saipan this month and Asiana Airlines plans to start its service for the resort island from July. \nKorean Air also opened tickets for Guam set to leave this November... while T' Way and Air Seoul plan to start flight services for the same route this summer. \nOver in Europe, Switzerland, Spain, and France are also welcoming vaccinated travelers. \nAnd those vaccinated in Korea won't need to quarantine when returning from their trip either.\nBut one thing to be careful, though, is that each country has slightly different COVID-19 protocols for incoming travelers\u2026\nSome countries only grant quarantine-free entry for certain types of COVID-19 vaccines. \nFor example, Guam only recognizes U.S. FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines, such as Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson. \nHowever, AstraZeneca has not yet been FDA-approved so those who had the AstraZeneca shot will still have to quarantine.\nSo, you do have to look into the details before traveling.  \n\n So Korea's air carriers are gradually getting these international flights going again, and planning more. It's been a rough time for the airlines and their employees. Not to mention the many mom and pop travel agencies in Korea.\nAre they getting back on their feet now?\n\n Not just yet... travel agencies and the airline industry are still crippled by the pandemic. \nMany staff are still on unpaid leave as profits have yet to jump back to pre-pandemic levels. \nAt the moment, they're gearing up to get their businesses running again. \nHave a listen. \n\n(KOR-\ub0a8\uc790) \ud558\ub098\ud22c\uc5b4 4\ubd8427\ucd08 \n\"There are not many reservations for overseas travel yet, but they are more inquiries compared to the past. Right now, we're more focused on getting ready to offer safe travel packages for overseas tours.\" \n\n Insiders agree that it will take a while for firms to fully recover.\nBut they say the announcement of a travel bubble last week brought great hope.   \n\n(KOR-\ub0a8\uc790) \ucc38\uc88b\uc740\uc5ec\ud589 11\ubd8410\ucd08 \n \"With the latest travel bubble announcement, it feels like we can finally see the end of the tunnel. \nThe hardest part is going through a tunnel where you don't know when it's going to end. But now that we know where that is, we just need to bear it for a few more months.\" \n\n Well said by the person you interviewed. \"A few more months\" is what we've all been hearing for a long time now. When do you see travel starting to resembly what we used to consider normal?\n\n Perhaps the Korean Thanksgiving holiday 'Chuseok' will look more like pre-COVID times. \nThat's because the government aims to vaccinate about 70 percent of the country's total population by September. \nThis year's 'Chuseok' is set to run from September 20th to the 22nd\u2026 and including the weekends\u2026 it will be a five-day holiday for all.\nSo, this is when the airline and travel industries expect to see an actual uptick in booking rates.\n\n(KOR-\ub0a8\uc790) \ucc38\uc88b\uc740\uc5ec\ud589 2\ubd84 30\ucd08\n  \"By the time we get to the Chuseok holiday, when most of the population has been fully vaccinated, we expect demand for overseas travel to be higher. It could be the start of a return to normal travel.\"\n\n One thing that's happened as the vaccine campaign progresses and the government talks about travel bubbles... is that airline and travel-related stocks are up. Tell us about that.\n\nAbsolutely. South Korea's airline stocks have been rising significantly in line with the country's rapid vaccine rollout and hopes for overseas travel. \n On the day of the travel bubble announcement last week, shares of Korean Air closed 4 percent higher at over 30 U.S. dollars and its parent Hanjin KAL rose 4 percent at about 67 dollars. \nLow-cost carriers saw their stocks jump on the same day with Jeju Air up almost 6 percent, Jin Air 5 percent and T'way Air 19 percent.\nLocal travel stocks were also up for the same reason. \nSome analysts even expect the stocks to go higher in the second half of this year. \n\n(\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc788\ub294 \uc804\ud654\uc778\ud130\ubdf0 -KOR-\ub0a8\uc790) \n \"The pent-up demand in travel means the recovery is expected to continue throughout 2023. The recovery cycle will be quite similar to that of the Lehman Brothers' financial crisis, that went from 2008 to 2010. The only difference is that the gains will be higher since economic fallout from the pandemic was worse.\" \n\n Good to hear that travel may be returning to normal and industries are getting back on their feet. \nThank you for today's report. \n\n Thank you.",

Joining us live in the studio is Dr. Go Myong-hyun, our senior North Korea analyst.\nDr. Go, as always, great to see you this evening. \n \n\n\n Kim Jong-un chaired a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's central committee yesterday, and urged measures to tackle the \"tense\" food situation worsened by last year's typhoons and the pandemic. He said agricultural success is North Korea's \"most important priority that desperately calls for national-level efforts.\" Judging from Kim's remarks, how bad do you assume North Korea's food crisis to be?\n\n Kim has been unusually frank about North Korea's economic failures since the beginning of this year, saying his five-year economic plan had failed in almost every sector. Do you think there's an ulterior motive of Kim being very open about the internal crisis?\n\n Among the big meeting's main agendas include countering long-term emergency quarantine. What do we know so far about the pandemic situation in the world's most isolated state, and would North Korea respond to international offers to help? President Moon, during his state visit to Austria, said he will actively seek vaccine aid to the North upon request, while Pope Francis has also reportedly expressed willingness to visit North Korea. \n\n The plenary meeting will also discuss \"international affairs and the party's corresponding measures,\" according state-media KCNA. What kind of message is expected to Seoul or Washington?\n\n Nominee for U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink during a confirmation hearing said that he would be \"delighted to learn more about the BRINK Act\" and how the U.S. can strengthen the sanctions regime... and that \"enforcing the sanctions regime is vitally important to the denuclearization goals\". Tell us about the BRINK Act, and does this imply that Washington may toughen sanctions on the North?\n\n There's been a rush of diplomatic gatherings by the western powers recently, with members of the G7 and NATO welcoming Washington's North Korea policy. What impact would stronger western ties against North Korea, as well as China threats have on denuclearization efforts?\n\n Japanese media reports say the new U.S. pointman on North Korea Sung Kim will be in Seoul next week for high-level talks with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. What are we expecting?\n\n It's already been 21 years since the historic first inter-Korean summit was held by late president Kim Dae-jung and late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, but inter-Korean relations remain icy cold. Marking the anniversary of the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration, give us insights as to how involving parties can meet halfway and bring North Korea back to the negotiating table. \n\n Thank you as always.",

Could you first tell us the significance of the visit?\n\n President Moon is holding summit talks with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez as we speak. What do you think the key takeaways will be from the summit?\n\n Expanding South Korea-Spain economic partnership is high on the agenda as President Moon took part in the 'green digital business forum' earlier in the day where he highlighted the need for low-carbon and digital economic cooperation between the two countries. \nWhat kind of business deals are we expecting from the two sides?\n\n President Moon is also scheduled to join an annual business leaders' forum in Barcelona. Which areas can we expect further boost in bilateral economic partnership can we expect?\n\n President Moon, during a welcoming dinner hosted by King Felipe VI, said Korea hopes for Spain's cooperation in shared goals like tackling climate change and the 4th Industrial Revolution. How do you assess the level of bilateral cooperation in areas that are now deemed critical to national security, such as climate change and various science and technology industries?\n\n President Moon's state visit to Spain comes on the heels of the G7 Summit where a confrontational declaration was issued against Russia and China. But there were some cracks when trying to find a common ground on some big issues. Where does Spain stand in Washington's push to form a united western front against Russia and China?\n\n Dr. Ramon Pacheco Pardo joining us live from London. Thank you for sharing your insights.",

President Biden's first overseas trip to Europe is expected to further intensify U.S. pressure on China. \n This as both the G7 and NATO endorsed Washington's stance,... acknowledging that Beijing presents (quote) \"systemic challenges.\"\nAgainst this backdrop,... tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. \nChina's air force flew a record 28 warplanes into Taiwan's air-defense identification zone Tuesday,... to which the U.S. responded by flying its own surveillance planes into the region.\n Watchers say tensions between the world's two superpowers could escalate,... especially with China celebrating the centennial anniversary of the founding of its Communist Party on July 1st.\nKim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.",

But due to COVID-19, I can't do that any more. So I first joined 'Mask Militia', which ended last year, and now I'm here with the 'Vaccination Militia'. I am doing this thinking I can go wherever I'm needed.\"\n\n(Stand-up ed: Steve) \n \"This is a vaccination center at Nowon-gu District in Seoul\u2026 a district with one of the highest vaccination rates in the city. Here, 720 Pfizer shots are given out each day, some as 2nd doses for people over the age of 75 and the rest as 1st doses to eligible \nvaccine recipients under the age of 30.\"\n\n Health authorities had 200-thousand Pfizer doses available for certain groups under-30, and opened reservations earlier this month. With such high demand... the reservations ended in just two days... six days earlier than what the authorities had planned. \n\nA young recipient told us one reason behind such a high sign-up rate for the vaccines. \n\n(Korean - \ub0a8)\n\"After searching \"vaccination\" online, you can just input your social security number and find the nearest center... all in under five minutes. If things were complicated, I would've been too lazy to sign up and would've just waited for a text from the government.\"\n\n Vaccinations for those under 30 who work in the medical field will pick up speed even further as Moderna is rolled out. \nIt will be given out at 45 different hospitals nationwide... and so far 55-thousand doses have been distributed. \nModerna is the fourth type of vaccine that's being used in the country. \nKim Do-yeon, Arirang News.",

They\u2019re soldiering on with a sense of professionalism in mind, but they\u2019re now at the limits of their physical and psychological endurance.\n\nDr. IHM Jin-soo, President / Korea Association of Public Health Doctors\n Regional authorities want public health professionals like ourselves to handle most of the tasks, down to the most basic of civil inquiries. They think we should be doing all the work, saying we\u2019re the experts in the field.\nSome public servants even gave doctors a scolding for being late with their diagnostic reports. Sometime it feels like we\u2019re doing all the work for them, and that in itself is very stressful. \n\nThe fear of infection... from a working in a high-risk environment... is also adding to their psychological burden.\n\nJUNG Sun-jae, Assistant Professor / Yonsei University College of Medicine\nAccording to our survey, having to a wear a protective suit was the single biggest contributor to stress among medical workers. 81% of the respondents said they felt distressed when wearing a protective suit, and 60% were worried about contracting the coronavirus from patients.\n\nMedical workers from across the globe... are also voicing their frustration... over the challenges they\u2019re facing.\n\nIn Europe,... healthcare workers took to the streets in protest,... against the lack of government support... that has left them struggling to cope amid the pandemic.\n\nAdrian DURTSCHI, Head of UNICare / UNI Global Union (26\ucd08)\nThere are related reasons for example to the burden of work. At the moment lot of the staffs in hospitals and nursing homes. They really work 24/7. Every weekend almost have no rest. \tThey are under stress. They are getting burn out. That is also linked to then other medical reasons. We even had cases of suicide related to that stress and burn out. \n\nIn early-June,... the Korean government announced new measures... to help address the mental health challenges being faced by the country\u2019s medical workers.\n \nWith our fight against COVID-19 far from over,... what more can be done... to help medical workers cope with the psychological burden of the pandemic?\n\nJUNG Sun-jae, Assistant Professor / Yonsei University College of Medicine\nWe need to provide spaces for medical workers where they can take a break in between shifts, and also create a work structure that allows them to do so. We also need to draw a clear line between who\u2019s on and off duty, so that medical workers can fully rest and recharge after work.\n\nWe must continue to watch and monitor the mental health of medical workers, even after the pandemic. \n\nFrontline medical workers have helped to save millions of lives... from COVID-19,... and it\u2019s now our turn to save them... through compassion and support... that are genuinely understanding of their needs.",

Good to have you back on.\n\n Good afternoon.\n\n The big news overnight was the Federal Open Markets Committee. Rates not changing yet, but the so-called dot plot now signaling two rate hikes in 2023. Jerome Powell also says that they're talking about talking about tapering. Tell us what came out of the Fed on Wednesday.\n\n \n\n\n\nAll this has introduced a dose of volatility to the markets. We can see that in today's exchange rate in Korea. Most Asian markets are down. But what effect do you see this having on the Korean financial markets, and globally? And for that matter, how can Korea respond?\n\n\n\n\n\n On Wall Street overnight, not a huge reaction to the talk about talking about tapering. But there was a decline of about half a percent on the S&P and a little more on the Nasdaq. What was the story on Wall Street?\n\n\n\n\n\n Today in Korea, it was an interesting session... in that the KOSPI was down by around half a percent. But the KOSDAQ was up about the same amount. A lot of selling on the KOSPI by foreigners and institutions. Tell us about the local market.\n\n\n\n\n\n Korea's had quite an impressive recovery in exports since the start of the pandemic. but there are reports out there by economists saying that growth might not be so strong in the second half of this year. What's the concern there, and what might be done to keep the momentum going?",

What's your overall assessment of summit results? Did the two leaders return home with what they wanted?\n\n Agreeing to resume talks on \"strategic stability\" of nuclear arsenals is picked as one of the concrete outcomes of the summit. This follows Washington's extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, with Russia for five more years. Tell us more about this treaty, and what significance does resumption of U.S.-Russia nuclear talks hold?\n\n Deep differences were evident, however, on a number of issues such as cyberattacks, Ukraine, and human rights issues involving Russia's opposition leader Alexei Navalny. What do you make of the summit outcomes on those thorny issues?\n\n The summit came on the heels of the G7 Summit and NATO meeting where Biden aggressively sought a united western front against the increasing influence of Russia and China. How is Russia observing Biden's return to traditional U.S. foreign policy?\n\n The summit came when U.S.-Russia relations have hit a rock bottom. What's your forecast of the two powerful nations' relations in the coming years?\n\n Victoria Zhuravleva at the Primakov National Research Institute joining us live from Moscow.

GIVEN this PACE... of VACCINATION... what are your PROSPECTS... on the GOAL... of... OFFERING... A DOSE... to a TOTAL... of 36-MILLION people... by September?\n\n3) Professor Kim... authorities have made public... the GIST... of their third-quarter vaccination plan.\nAnd... DO CORRECT ME...

EARLIER... received... the AstraZeneca dose?\n((What are the chances... of BROADENING... this method of inoculation... to the general public?))\n\n6) Professor Shin... STARTING... LATE JULY... authorities are looking to OFFER... GREATER VACCINATION AUTHORITY... to local governments... and... 24-hour businesses.\nWhat is behind... this MOVE... and... what... may be... some of the RISKS involved?\n\n7) Professor Kim... perhaps... the KEY VARIABLE... with regard... to Korea's hopes... for herd immunity... is ADEQUATE VACCINE SUPPLY.\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n8) Professor Shin... the NOVAVAX vaccine will be ROLLED OUT... in the THIRD QUARTER.\nWhat can you tell us... about its EFFICACY... and SAFETY?\n\n9) Professor Kim... recently... a man in his 30s... passed away... AFTER BEING CONFIRMED... with rare blood clotting... following inoculation... with the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nAs of now... the AstraZeneca vaccine is offered to those... aged... between... 30 and 60... here in Korea.\nDo we need... to ADJUST... this AGE REQUIREMENT?\n\n10) Professor Shin... what MEASURES... do you PROPOSE... to ENSURE... a SAFE VACCINATION PROCESS... as... authorities LOOK... to BROADEN... their RECIPIENT... BASE?\n\n11) Professor Kim... do REMIND us... about the PREVENTION MEASURES... NECESSARY... to ALLOW... for HERD IMMUNITY... within the year.\n\nADDITIONAL QUESTION\n12) Professor Shin... a recent survey shows... GROWING PUBLIC SUPPORT... of the country's COVID-19 STRATEGY... with more than 60-percent... of RESPONDENTS... in a POLL... THIS MONTH... PRAISING... government efforts...

        "artcl_ctt": "It's Friday,... and that means it's time for our regular segment 'Life With Culture' segment, full of interesting cultural events we can enjoy over the weekend. Our culture correspondent Kim Bo-kyoung is here with us in the studio,... Bo-kyoung, I heard that visitors to the royal palaces can enjoy some cultural performances with a difference?\n\nThat's right Conn-young,... as you know, the royal palaces are peaceful and tranquil places where you can enjoy the ambience of the Joseon Dynasty's long history.\n(\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) And at Changgyeonggung Palace, there is also the rare chance to see dance and gugak -- Korean traditional music -- together in one performance.\nLet me give you a peek.\n\n\nYou don't have to travel far to find quiet spots that are rich with history.\nThe royal palaces nestled in the heart of Seoul,... offer citizens a comforting place to relax. \nTo create a unique experience,... the Cultural Heritage Administration came up with a daily small performance series taking place in Changgyeonggung Palace.\n\n(Standup/ed:steve)\n\"For those who feel like escaping the bustle of the city.... and enjoying the perfect weather with a soft breeze... you can relax and watch shows in the palace grounds while sitting on a comfy bean bag.\u201d\n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8)\n\"To let citizens find some comfort and overcome the Corona Blues,... we were allowed to use the forest of Changgyeonggung Palace as a stage. We hope traditional and contemporary dance together at one site along with gugak band's songs can help relieve people's stress.\" \n\nThe artist who performs the 'Salpuri' -- a national intangible cultural heritage,... says the backdrop of the centuries-old palaces could let viewers enjoy the ambience of the shows even more.\n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"'Salpuri' is one of the representative folk dances. As it literally means to wash away evil spirits,... the shamanic element was strongly embedded but now it's one of Korea's traditional arts. I believe presenting traditional dance in a major cultural heritage site could offer greater joy.\" \n\nThe audience seem delighted to see the live show.\n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"I went out to stroll with my friend because the weather is so nice. It has been a long time since I've seen a live show,... and it was great to see well-trained performers and traditional dance. I will come again next time. I enjoyed it so much today.\"\n\nThe shows will take place at 3PM and 5 PM everyday,... until June 27th.\nEach show is limited to 50 audience members due to COVID-19.\nFor shows until June 18th, those interested can get the tickets at site for free,... while for performances from the 19th to the 27th, people need to register in advance through the Naver booking website. (PKG\ub05d)\n\n(STUDIO BACK)\n\nThose shows at Changgyeonggung Palace sound so peaceful and relaxing. Now, that sounds great for those interested in Korea's traditional culture,... what about for K-pop fans? \n\nFans of K-pop will be hyped to hear that the world's largest virtual Korean culture and music festival -- \"KCON:TACT 4 U\" will take place from tomorrow, (\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) June 19th,... until June 27th.\nKCON is the world\u2019s largest fan celebration of Korean culture and music. It first started in Los Angeles in 2012,... but was turned into an online event called \"KCON:TACT\" last year due to the pandemic.\nAround 26 K-pop artists will be presenting shows as if they are on a world tour,... visiting previous countries where KCON has been held in the past.\nThe concert series and fan engagement extravaganza that lets viewers get to know more about Korean culture will be live-streamed through CJ ENM's online video service TVING for domestic fans,... and through KCON official and the Mnet K-POP YouTube channels for fans overseas.\nThose who would like to enjoy it in widescreen with surround sound can visit 15 CGV cinemas including CGV Gangnam,... which will live stream the K-pop artists' eye-catching shows.\n\nK-pop fans will be very excited to see their favorite K-pop idols and artists! Thank you Bo-kyoung for sharing this information as always. I will see you next week.\n\nThank you.",

        "artcl_ctt": "MEANWHILE... for MORE COVERAGE... of Korea's THIRD QUARTER... VACCINATION AGENDA... I have... Kim Sung-hyun (\uae40\uc131\ud604)... here in the studio.\nWelcome... Sung-hyun.\n\n Good afternoon. \n\n NOW... before... we delve into... the actual plan... LET'S BEGIN... with NEWS... about REMARKABLE PROTECTION... against COVID-19... EVEN... AFTER... A SINGLE DOSE?\n\n That\u2019s right. Korea's health authorities said in Thursday\u2019s afternoon government briefing... that AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines were 84 percent effective... in protecting seniors aged 60 or older... even after just one shot. \n\n The KDCA analyzed more than 9-and-a-half million people aged 60 or older,... including 5-and-a-half million who received the first dose... of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The AstraZeneca vaccine was 78.9 percent effective against COVID-19... after the passing of two weeks following inoculation... while the Pfizer vaccine was 86.6 percent effective. \n\n \u201cOur analysis on the effectiveness of vaccines... at 8 types of venues including nursing homes where mass outbreaks have occurred,... showed that vaccines were 100% effective in preventing death,... and 86.1% effective in preventing transmissions... including asymptomatic infections.\u201d\n\n In fact, both AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines were 100 percent effective in preventing deaths from the novel coronavirus in people aged 60 or older. The data showed 109 deaths from nearly five-thousand COVID-19 cases in the unvaccinated group,... but no fatalities were reported from vaccinated people. \n\n That's good to know!\nNow... let's turn... to the country's inoculation schedule... for the third quarter.\n\n Sure, Sunny. Korea will begin inoculating the younger population starting next month... In total,... the country plans to vaccinate 22 million people between the ages of 18 and 59,... in the third quarter,... according to health authorities.\n\n The KDCA announced its list of third-quarter vaccine recipients,... with the goal of vaccinating 36 million people,... or 70 percent of the nation's population,... by September. Authorities will expand the vaccination program... to age groups under 60 from July.\n First and foremost,... a total of 170,000 people who had vaccine appointments booked for June,... but didn't get their shots due to supply issues... will be the top priority group in July. High school seniors who will be taking their college entrance exams later this year... and teachers under 30... at schools and daycare centers... will also get their shots starting July. Meanwhile, people in their 50s are set to receive their first shots starting late-July. Further breaking down that age group,... people between 55 and 59 will get their vaccines on the last week of July... and those between 50 and 54 in the beginning of August. Those between the ages of 18 and 49... will be inoculated from mid-August and throughout September. This also includes autonomous vaccinations... by regional authorities and workplaces as well. And starting September,... people in welfare blind spots,... including disadvantaged senior citizens,... people with serious disabilities, as well as the homeless... will also be receiving their vaccines. \n\n And... I believe... authorities have granted the greenlight... to CROSS-INOCULATION?\n\n Yes, Sunny... Korea's third-quarter vaccination plan... also includes mix-and-match inoculations. The KDCA said it will allow AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines to be combined in two-shot regimens... starting next month.\n\n Some 760,000 people,... including in-home caregivers aged over 30,... medical workers at community health centers and pharmacies,... as well as other essential personnel,... such as police officers and firefighters... will be eligible for mix-and-match vaccines.\n\n \"The delivery of 835,000 AstraZeneca doses from COVAX will be pushed back to a time later than July,... so we believe it's necessary to allow the mixing and matching of vaccines... rather than risk delaying the vaccination schedule.\u201d\n\n According to the KDCA,... this group received the AstraZeneca vaccine for their first dose in April,... and will receive Pfizer vaccines for their second dose... after July 5th. Health authorities said mix-and-match vaccines are strictly voluntary... and will only be given to those... who give their consent.  This decision comes... amid uncertainties in vaccine supply... with a delivery of 835,000 AstraZeneca doses from the COVAX facility... being delayed from June to July. The KDCA said global studies on mix-and-match vaccines,... have revealed no safety issues... and some studies even suggest that combining different vaccines... may even create higher antibody levels... than two doses of the same vaccine.\n\n All right... Sung-hyun... as always... thank you... for that coverage.",

As a result, its overall revenue is about 10 to 20 percent higher.\n\n Other than Avenanthramide, the substance effective against dementia, oats contain other nutrients including  protein, vitamins, fiber and beta-glucan.\nWhich is why more products are incorporating oats as an ingredient. Oats can now be found in soy milk, tea, or even in powered form.\n\n(KOREAN) \uc5ec \n \uc774\uc720\uc601 / \ub18d\ucd0c\uc9c4\ud765\uccad \ub18d\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad6c\uc0ac\nIt's healthy to add oats to rice, but it's not an effective way to absorb all the nutritional benefits. It's actually better to eat oats in their processed form.\n\nAs the consumption of oats rises,  the Rural Development Administration plans to increase the domestic cultivation area to 3,000 hectares by 2025.\nIt also aims to develop technologies that can use oats as materials for the bio industry.

Thanks for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Stocks on Wall Street were mixed overnight in their first full session after the FOMC's latest meeting. The Nasdaq was up a fair bit, but the Dow closed lower. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n \n\n\n\n Here in Korea, both main indices higher, especially the KOSDAQ, which was also up yesterday. The KOSPI is now well above a thousand points. Strength today in tech stocks and some bio names. Tell us about the domestic market.\n\n \n\n\n\n The Fed's talk yesterday about raising rates and tapering has had an effect on Korean won's exchange rate with the dollar. It's back up to about 11-30 against the dollar, which is the highest it's been in about four weeks. What do you see happening with the exchange rate?\n\n \n\n\n\n The Korean government and the city of Seoul have been trying to cool off the housing market. But despite those efforts, apartment prices in the capital rose this week... on a week-to-week basis... by the most in a year and a half. It doesn't seem the current strategy to bring down prices is working. What does that mean to you, and where do you see the housing market going forward?",

We speak to his senior communications secretary for an overall review.\n\n Ready for both dialogue and confrontation.

U.S. President Joe Biden said it is highly unlikely,... highlighting the importance of getting vaccinated. \n\n(ENGLISH - \ub0a8) reuters #5207\n\"It's a variant that is more easily transmissible, potentially deadlier, and particularly dangerous for young people. But the good news is we have the solution[...]The best way to protect yourself against these variants is to get fully vaccinated. So please, please. If you have one shot, get the second shot.\n\nAnd to prevent the spread of the Delta variant,... Italy is imposing a mandatory five-day quarantine for all visitors from the UK from June 21st.\nThis comes as the delta variant now accounts for more than 90 percent of the UK's new COVID-19 cases.\nWith the daily cases hovering around 7-thousand,... the UK has also delayed its easing of lockdown restrictions in England for four weeks until July 19th.\nKim Sung-min, Arirang News",

And we worked together, and the end result happens to be something great, so I''m very pleased.\"\nAs for Lee''s future plans ... he says he hopes to return and ...\n?\u0007\"7:17:16 work with the Korean film society, and the film industry, and kind of marry what I have learned in America, to my identity here in Korea... and do something I hope special here.\"\nRight now... he''s already at work on another piece.. this time a feature length action movie.\nA special screening of \"A Nursery Tale\" will be presented at the Sunjae Art Center on January fifth.\nRah Seungyun, Arirang TV.?",
