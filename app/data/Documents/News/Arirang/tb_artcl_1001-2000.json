INCENTIVES.\nFor more... I have Yoon Jung-min (\uc724\uc815\ubbfc)... here... in the studio... with me.\nWelcome... Jung-min.\n\n Hello, Sun-hee.\n\n Let's start off... with... the PLANNED... EASE... in PREVENTION PRACTICES... for THOSE... vaccinated.\n\n Sure. \nThe government aims to ease social distancing guidelines in three stages... allowing larger groups of people... to meet for private gatherings.\nIf you take a look at our graph here...\n South Korea aims to inoculate 13 million people by June.\nFor those who have gotten their first COVID-19 vaccine shots,... they can hold family gatherings with more than eight people... two weeks after getting their shots.\nFrom July,... vaccinated people will not be subject to attendance limits at private gatherings, including religious services.\nAnd they will not be required to wear a mask outdoors... except at large rallies.\nFrom October,... we can expect a broader easing of social distancing restrictions,... including the lifting of indoor mask mandate... possibly from December.\n\n(Korean) \ub0a8 \ub179\ucde8 (May 26, 2021)\n \"Based on how effective the vaccines have been,... the government plans to adjust its social distancing guidelines in phases... and provide vaccine incentives... to help people return to their normal lives.\"\n\n To encourage more people to get vaccinated,... the government may also offer discounts... on entrance fees at public facilities.\nPeople can get a hard-copy certificate... or digital proof on their mobile phones... after getting vaccinated,... which they can use to receive these benefits.\nThe government however,... may reconsider offering these incentives... if they fall short of their inoculation goal.\n There are concerns, too.\nSome say that it may not be easy to distinguish those vaccinated from those who are not... in crowded areas with a large number of people.\nThe health authorities dismissed concerns... over the lifting of mask mandates,... saying that even getting one vaccine dose... significantly lowers the risk of transmission.\n\n---\n Perhaps... there are lessons... to be learned... from countries... that have INOCULATED... a large number... of their population?\n\n Right. In the U.S., a number of companies are changing their masking policies... following a new guidance from the CDC.\n They include Starbucks, Walt Disney, Walmart and Costco.\nStarbucks says it will make facial coverings optional... for vaccinated customers.\nWalt Disney has announced that masks and face coverings will be \"optional in outdoor common areas\" at the theme park, with some exceptions.\nThis follows... an earlier CDC announcement... that fully-vaccinated people don't have to wear masks... nor practice social distancing... when indoors or outdoors.\nState governments,... including Hawaii,... have also started easing restrictions... after vaccinating a large number of residents.\nTake a look.\n\n(English) \ub0a8 (May 25, 2021) ap \t4327919 / 1\n \"You will not be required to wear a mask while outside. However, we do strongly encourage everyone when they are outside in large groups to continue to wear a mask. The mask mandate is not changing indoors.\"\n\n In Israel,... its health minister announced on Sunday that... from June, almost all COVID-19 restrictions in the country will be lifted.\nThe minister added... that the country may no longer need the Green Pass,... a permit to access indoor venues for vaccinated people... or those who've recovered from COVID-19.\nHowever,... people in Israel will have to continue wearing face masks... when indoors.\nIsraeli health authorities say they will maintain restrictions regarding entry into and departure from the country... to tackle the threat of variants.\n\n---\n AND... staying with FACE MASKS... I understand... some experts are advising caution... regarding the lifting of mask mandates.\n\n Right. A top official from the WHO... says individual governments must carefully assess their local situation... if they plan to lift mask mandates.\nTake a listen.\n\n\n(English) \ub0a8 reuters 5180\n \"In the instance of a country that wishes to reduce or take away a mask mandate or take away other measures of public health and social measures, that should only be done in the context of considering both the intensity of transmission in your area and the level of vaccination coverage.\"\n\n Some experts say there have been cases... where fully-vaccinated people were infected,... and there are still concerns over new variants that are more infectious,... so it might be too early... to allow people to take their masks off.\n\n Alright. Thank you for the coverage.\n\n  My pleasure.",

Thank you for coming on today.\n\n \n\n Stocks were up overnight in New York as concerns ease about inflation, and the American economy opens back up. It'll soon be summer vacation season in the U.S. so that's giving a boost to parts of the economy that had been shut down. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n\n\n\n\n Here in Korea, today, stocks were mixed. There's concern that new data from the U.S. on consumer spending will actually show more inflation. The KOSPI was a little lower and the KOSDAQ a little higher. What's the story today in the Korean market?\n\n \n\n\n\n Back in the first quarter of this year, Korea's household debt rose to around 1-point-6 trillion U.S. dollars. We've seen people borrowing a lot of money to buy homes but also to invest in stocks. There's talk of the Fed tapering its bond buying. Tell us about that and how it figures into the debt situation.\n\n \n\n\n\n The Bank of Korea today, as expected, decided to keep rates where they are at a record low of half a percent. We've been here now for a year. What was behind that decision?\n\n \n\n\n\n The BOK has also raised its GDP growth forecast this year to 4 percent. Exports too are expected to rise. And that's a concern to some... because the thinking has been that the BOK wouldn't raise rates until after next year. Do you think it might happen sooner than that?",

And this has an enormous scientific, commerical, as well security implications for the Reublic of Korea because as they develop the space faring capabilities, the Republic of Korea, its private sector companies, universities, and the government are going to develop better earth observation satellites, better communication satellites and capabilites that are really going to bring the Republic of Korea more global.\" \n\nAnd, now for a Korean expert's point of view, let's bring in Im Jong-bin, Head of Space Policy & Cooperation at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute. \nKorea Aerospace Research Institute has been working with South Korea's Science and ICT Ministry as well as NASA, the U.S. State and Defense Departments to sign the Artemis Accord. \n\n   \n\n Im Jong-bin, you have been involved in the process leading up to South Korea's joining the Artemis Project and you and your institute will be taking a leading role in South Korea's contribution in the Artemis Program.\nArtemis is NASA's new lunar exploration program, which includes sending the first woman and the next man on the Moon... for the first time in nearly 50 years. \nCould you first tell us more about the Artemis program and its ultimate goal?\n\n 9 countries, including the UK and Japan have signed the Artemis accords so far and South Korea became the the first country to sign the accords under the Biden administration. What significance does it hold to Korea's aerospace industry and beyond?\n\n What specific area will South Korea be participating in landing Artemis on the Moon, and what are your prospects for Korea's level of contribution?\n\n South Korea and the U.S. have also recently signed a joint statement on satellite navigation cooperation aiming for U.S. technological cooperation in developing KPS, or Korean Positioning System. What is the main goal of KPS and why is it important?\n\n We hear Korea is also developing 'Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter' in collaboration with NASA. Tell us more about this.\n\n Bang Hyo-Choong, professor of Aerospace Engineering at KAIST for us tonight, thank you. We appreciate your expertise.",

BTS continues to write history with its unprecedented global success. \nAs if the long list of its extraordinary achievements isn't enough, the South Korean boyband scooped up four Billboard Music Awards while expanding their influence on America's favorite TV shows and the country's biggest fast food brand. \nThe sweeping success of BTS and its implications for the expansion of K-pop -- It's the topic of our news in-depth tonight with Kim Young-dae, a pop culture critic and author of \"BTS: The Review.\"\nKim Young-dae, thanks for coming in today.\n\n \n\n\n Wow. Before we delve any further into our discussion tonight, you authored a whole analysis of BTS. Tell us a little bit about yourself.\n\n The latest trophy added to BTS' long list of awards is the Billboard Music Awards... taking home the awards in Top Selling Song, Top Song Sales, Top Duo/Group and Top Social Artist categories. You examine their unprecedented global success in your book. What are the implications of their latest win?\n\n BTS blew the roof off the stage at their Good Morning America summer concert and fans were in a frenzy. The entire event was also lived streamed as part of a virtual event straight from Central Park.\nBTS is not a newcomer to the GMA's summer concert, but this year BTS kicked off the GMA's 2021 Summer Concert Series with 'Butter' & 'Dynamite' performances. What's the significance?\n\n BTS is being a part of America's big cultural moments, also making a cameo in the highly-anticipated \"Friends\" the reunion that premiered last Thursday. I mean, this is Friends we are talking about. We all grew up a Rachel, Monica, a Phoebe phase. I mean, how many of us haven't curled up in a ball and watched Friends all day after a bad break up. And, now this seven-piece band from South Korea... they're ON FRIENDS THE REUNION. What do you, what should we be making of this?\n\n \"BTS Meal\" is a smash hit at McDonalds, and the collaboration between the K-pop star and the U.S. fast food chain went beyond nuggets, showcasing a limited-edition merchandise line. How do you analyze the marketing power of BTS and furthermore, the economic influence of K-pop?\n\n \"BTS Meal\" will be available in over 50 countries which is nearly half of McDonald's export countries. But strangely enough, they're not available in Asia's biggest markets, Japan or China. BTS's \"Friends\" reunion cameo scene was also deleted in China. What are your thoughts?\n\n What measures are needed to carry on the momentum of the K-pop industry's huge global success?\n\n Pop culture critic, Kim Young-dae for our news in-depth tonight. Thank you for your insights.",

Would it be safe enough to go around without masks after just one shot of vaccine? \n\n If these rules were to be eased for those who have gotten their first shots, are there measures in to discern people who are vaccinated from those who are not? \n\n Vaccinations began for over 65s from today while reservation services for 'no show' leftover vaccines also kicked off today. Would we be able to reach the government's vaccination target of 13 million people during the first half of this year?\n\n The number of patients infected with four primary variants in Korea reached near 280 in the past week alone. Some infectious disease experts are warning new variants could become the dominant strain in the country. What's your forecast?\n\n Moderna has completed business registration for its Korean branch 'Moderna Korea'. What are your prospects for vaccine partnership between Samsung Biologics and Moderna?\n\n Dr. David Kwak, Clinical Professor of Soon Chun Hyang University Hospital for our news in-depth tonight.

She said that this is the time to come up with an innovative solution in dealing with climate change for which Denmark plans to continue to cooperate with South Korea.\nColombia's President said despite the fact they only contribut to less than 1 percent of global carbon emission they are willing to contribute in achieving carbon neutrality. \nColombia pledged to make continuous efforts in expanding the use of electric vehicles, production of renewable energy.\nThe President of European Commission said that year 2020 will determine the next 10 years. \nThey are to reduce 55 percent of carbon emission in the next 10 years.\nVietnam's Prime Minister said developed countries should play the leading roles in helping developing countries to follow along energy transitions and contribute in reducing carbon emission.\nUS special envoy for climate John Kerry emphasized that to prevent crisis the global community needs to act now.\nHe said countries should aim to reduce Earth's temperature by 1-point-5 Celsius and welcomes South Korea for joining such effort.\nThat would include reducing use of fossil fuels and investing on green renewable energy.\nThe U.S. announced that they will invest about twice more on developing countries to aid their energy transition.\nCountries should aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 to produce more jobs and enhance state security.\n\nNow Yoo, this was a virtual summit so they must have put a lot of effort into keeping the event entertaining.\nHow was it different to previous face-to-face summits?\n\nConnyoung, as you said, the P4G Seoul Summit was held virtually.\nAs the host country, South Korea wanted to show off its advanced technology in augmented reality and advanced media.\nDuring tonight's leaders' dialogue session, organizers used what they called \"video mapping technology\" to produce hologram-like images of sandy coasts, Suncheonman Bay Wetlands in Jeollanam-do Province, and mudflats which the Ministry of Environment had announced could disappear due to climate change.\nToday, you could also see objects that demonstrate South Korea's renewable energy technologies.\nThat includes a Hyundai Motors' hydrogen powered car, a solar energy module made by Hanhwa Q Cells, and Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction's wind power generator.\nDuring the opening ceremony yesterday, they also used the video mapping technology to fill in the empty space with a newly-translated version of a painting of Inwang Mountain in Seoul made in the Joseon Dynasty.\nDuring the opening ceremony, they also used what they called \"ViveStudios Immersive Technology\" which visualized an augmented reality of South Korea's pine tree forest and endangered animals.\nBack to you, Connyoung.",

It starts all over again when it\u2019s recycled and reused. We must create a business model where upcycling is profitable and determine who will bear the necessary costs. This will require discussions between consumers, businesses, institutions and the government. The circular economy is a broad concept that encompasses all of these aspects.\n\nYeongdeungpo-gu District, Seoul\n\nA special environmental campaign... is being held here today in the middle of Seoul.\n\nA joint endeavor between local firms and the Seoul city government,... the campaign is aimed at promoting better awareness... on the proper recycling of plastic bottles,... and encourages the participation of all citizens.\n\nRaising awareness on the the proper recycling of plastic bottles\n\nCHO Min-jeong, Participant\nAlthough I did learn how to recycle from an early age at school, nobody showed me how the actual process worked and how the recycled materials are used. It\u2019s great to see a recycled product like this that I can actually see and touch.\n\nSource: Hyosung TNC\n\nFor years now,... Hyosung TNC has been using a technology... that can extract polyester threads... from throwaway plastic bottles.\nUnlike conventional polyester fabric that is made from petroleum,... these threads are extracted from plastic bottles that are crushed into small chips,... which are then used to make clothing and other fashion items.  \n\nWANG Jong-mi, CEO / PLEAT MAMA \nThe thread that goes unused in the making of each of our bags weighs just one-tenth of a gram. So, the first step in addressing the problem is generating less waste to begin with, and the second is finding ways to either recycle them or find different uses. We felt the need to adopt a zero-waste manufacturing process in order to contribute to the whole cycle.\n\nThe fashion industry is one of the leading polluters in the world,... and the clothing that people throw away each year,... accounts for more than 80% of all textile waste,... which are then buried or incinerated.\n\nOnly 1% of the textile waste ends up being recycled,... highlighting the need for more sustainable changes in the fashion industry.\n\nLEE Seong-whee, Professor / Dept. of Environmental Energy Engineering, Kyonggi University\nBy adapting the principles of the circular economy, we can reduce the amount of waste that is being burned and buried, and even make use of the residue created from the incineration process. We are trying to create a zero-waste society that makes minimum use of landfills and incinerators.\n\nClimate change has also brought changes... in the way that businesses operate,... and companies are now wary of their carbon footprint,... as consumer have become more environmentally-conscious than ever before. Going green is no longer a sunk cost,... but an investment that can determine the fortunes of a business.\n\nThrough discussion on these agendas and more,... Korea is looking to build a climate action legacy of its own,... as it hosts the second P4G Summit.",

        "artcl_ctt": "It's Friday and that means it's time for our weekly 'Life With Culture' segment. Our culture correspondent Kim Bo-kyoung is here at the studio,... Welcome Bo-kyoung. I heard that there's a rare chance to enjoy Korea's traditional music this weekend?\n\nHi Conn-young,... you are right. National Gugak Center marks the 70th anniversary of its foundation this year and to commemorate the special year, (\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) the center's 'Jeongak Orchestra' -- which plays what is considered Korea's classical music,... has prepared a special show. Although the three-day performance ends on Saturday,... I thought it would be a great chance to briefly take a look at the center's history and listen to the beauty of Jeongak. Let's take a peek.\n\n\nThe unique sound of traditional Korean instruments being played together comes from a type of music which dates back more than a thousand years. \n \"Eumseongseo,\" an organization in charge of music during the Silla Dynasty, is considered to be an early version of Korea's home of traditional music: the National Gugak Center. \nAs time passed the name changed but its purpose of showcasing Korean traditional music for future generations remained.\nFollowing Korea's independence in 1945,... a petition was submitted to the government by Lee Ju-hwan, the representative of traditional musicians, urging for the establishment of a state-run organization similar to \"Eumseongseo\".\nThe petition was accepted... and the National Gugak Center was to be established. \nBut as the Korean War broke out in 1950... the center was set up in the temporary capital, Busan.\nThe center later returned to Seoul and had many different locations until it finally settled in the Seocho-dong neighborhood. \nThis year the National Gugak Center is in its 70th year and to celebrate, it is opening several special court music performances known as \"Jeongak,\" similar to classical music from the West.\n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8)\n\"It is not an exaggeration to say the center's history is also Jeongak's history. Ever since its establishment, Jeongak was the music that was usually played in royal courts or by the elite. It's different from folk music, it isn't very emotional - it's calm and peaceful as it was played to stimulate the minds of the literati.\"\n\nThe court music orchestra showcases what's called \"Yongsanhoesang\" -- which has three very distinct versions with instruments ranging from string to wind.\nOne of the orchestra members, who is the intangible cultural heritage holder for the royal ancestral ritual in the Jongmyo shrine and its music, says the task of promoting gugak is not yet finished.\n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8)\n\"From now on, the center needs to turn gugak into music that all people including people from other countries can enjoy. Making it globally-recognized is what we need to do to honor those who have struggled to preserve it.\"\n\nWith keen determination to preserve the beauty of gugak,... those who play and promote Korean traditional music are working together to ensure that gugak lives on for another thousand years.\n\n(PKG \ub05d / STUDIO BACK)\n\nIt's wonderful to hear how our thousand-year-old traditional music -- gugak is being preserved and played for us to enjoy. Turning to more recent music, I heard K-pop sensations BTS have yet another performance today?\n\nThat's right,... BTS are set to return to the 'Good Morning America' 2021 Summer Concert Series as the first performer in the series.\n(\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) BTS are among a lineup of more than 20 musicians including Pitbull.... who are to perform virtually on the famous U.S. morning talk show's summer series until August.\nThis is not their first time that BTS are a part of the show as they did a live performance of two songs \"Boy with Luv\" and \"Fire\" in 2019 at New York's Central Park.\nThis year's show comes a week after their second all-English song \"Butter\",... which according to the Guinness World Records,... has broken five world records across YouTube and Spotify including 'Most viewers for the premiere of a video on YouTube' and 'Most viewed YouTube music video in 24 hours'.\n\nWow that's amazing,...

SURPLUS VACCINES... here... in Korea... that... began... on Thursday.\nI have Kim Sung-hyun (\uae40\uc131\ud604)... here... in the studio.\nWelcome... Sung-hyun.\n\n Good afternoon. \n\n So... we touched upon... this... briefly... on its FIRST DAY... Sung-hyun.\nPeople can sign up... for... no show OR surplus... vaccines... for inoculation... on the same day?\n\n That\u2019s right. The service was launched Thursday afternoon... and received a warm welcome from the public. Bookings have been made available on KakaoTalk and Naver,... two of the country's most popular mobile apps. \n\n Anyone over the age of 30,... who is not yet eligible to get a vaccine,... can make same-day reservations for surplus doses... if they are available. The booking service on KakaoTalk and Naver are being supported by the KDCA,... which is providing them with real-time information on vaccination appointments and no-shows. The service generated a great deal of public interest,... but there weren't many leftover vaccines to begin with on the first day... and supplies quickly ran out. Moreover,... services were interrupted for a few hours due to a server overload... as people clamored to sign up for surplus vaccines.\n\n \u201cWe learned that Kakao had to reboot its servers due to too many people connecting at once... after we launched the service at 1 pm.\u201d \n\n The system is aimed at minimizing the waste of vaccines... from missed appointments and other factors. One AstraZeneca vial contains 10 doses,... and once it's opened,... any unused amount has to be discarded after six hours. The booking system will run for two weeks on a trial basis,... ahead of a full launch on June 9.\n\n MEANWHILE... in neighboring Japan... I believe... medical experts... there... are calling for... the cancellation... of the Tokyo Olympics?\n\n That\u2019s right. The Tokyo Olympics is set to take place in two months\u2019 time... and a top Japanese health expert warned Thursday,... that holding the Summer Games... could lead to the spread of new variants.\n\n Dr. Naoto Ueyama(\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc57c\ub9c8),... Chair of the Japan Doctors Union,... said the I-O-C and the Japanese government had underestimated the risk... of bringing tens of thousands of athletes, staff, officials, and members of the press... into the country. Ueyama,... joins the growing rank of medical experts in Japan... who have voiced their opposition to holding the Olympics. Another Japanese infectious disease expert... said the country is not ready to hold such a large-scale event,... especially given the risk of the Indian variant in particular. Take a listen.\n\n \u201cIf there is an increase in the movement of people and close contact,... when the outbreak isn't sufficiently contained,... we could see a rapid increase in the transmission rate. We are expecting a further rise in the number of new infections, given the presence of the Indian variant.\u201d \n\n Meanwhile,... the IOC and local organizers remain confident... that the Olympics and Paralympics will be (quote-unquote)\u201csafe and secure,\u201d... through extensive testing, strict protocols and social distancing,... with athletes set to be isolated at the Olympic Village alongside Tokyo Bay.\n\n Now... in contrast... China appears... confident... about... hosting the Beijing WINTER Olympics... as planned next year? \n\n That\u2019s right. China seems to be confident...in fact, six cities in China... including Beijing,... may be nearing herd immunity,... with the country reportedly handing out... a whopping one-hundred-million doses... in just five days.\n\n Just a month ago,... the world's most populous nation looked to be falling behind... in its vaccination drive. But, the country's inoculation campaign has taken off over the last several weeks,... and on Monday,... China announced that it had administered 546 million vaccine doses,... enough to inoculate around 20% of its population. China is now set to hand out 20 million daily shots,... more than triple the rate from a month ago. \n\n \"China has already set a world record by administering some 12 to 13 million shots a day... and if we have enough supplies,... it is even possible to hand out 20 million daily doses.\"\n\n If China can administer 20 million doses a day,... the country could reach one billion shots in total by June,... setting the country on track to fully vaccinate... its entire population by the end of this year. At its current pace,... China may also be able to vaccinate 70% of its population,... which is the estimated threshold for herd immunity... in just 90 days. With that,... the Chinese government is confident... that it can successfully hold the Beijing Winter Olympics as planned... after securing and reaching herd immunity before the Games kick off.\n\n All right... Sung-hyun... as always... thank you... for that coverage.",

Thanks for coming on today.\n\n Thank you. \n\n Overnight on Wall Street we saw the Dow Jones with a solid gain after U.S. jobless claims came in better than expected. Tech stocks were off, though, so the S&P was a little more subdued and the Nasdaq was flat. Mr. Yoo, take us through the global markets.\n\n \n\n\n\n Here in Korea there was a nice gain today in the markets. The KOSPI rising almost to 32-hundred but not quite. The KOSDAQ at almost 980. Investors are feeling good about the direction the economy is going. Tell us about the Korean market.\n\n \n\n\n\n Zooming out a little bit, the yield on 10 year treasury is now down below 1-point-6 percent. It's had a considerable rise, if you remember that we started the year below one percent. Investors all around the world are worried about what would happen if the Fed were to actually start raising rates. What do you think would happen in the markets if it does?\n\n \n\n\n\n We've seen the dollar index fall to below 90, which is about the weakest the dollar has been all year. How's that affecting the exchange rate? Right now we're at about 11-15 to the dollar. Where do you see it going from here?",

        "artcl_ctt": "Dec. 22, 2014 UN Security Council Meeting on North Korea\n\n \"When we first came to the council two years ago, one of the first issues we tackled was the DPRK's missile and nuclear issues.\nOur term on the council started and is ending with the North Korean issue.\nThis must be just a coincidence. But I'm saying this with a heavy heart.\nFor South Koreans, people in North Korea are not just anybodies.\nMillions of South Koreans still have our family members and relatives living in the North, even though we never heard from them, even though by now the pain of the separation has become a cold factor of life,\njust a few hundred kilometers away from where we live.\nWe cannot read what is described in the COI report, without it, breaking our hearts.\nWe cannot listen to the stories of North Korean defectors without sharing in their tears, without feeling as if we are there with them, experiencing their tragedies.\nWe only hope that one day in the future when we look back what we did today, we will be able to say that we did the right thing, for the people of North Korea, for the lives of every man, woman, boy, and girl who has the same human rights as the rest of us. Thank you.\"\n\nThe UN Security Council on that day in December 2014 took a groundbreaking step toward tackling the issue of North Korea's human rights situation. \nThis followed the passing of a key resolution on the issue in the UN General Assembly earlier that month based on the recommendtion of a Commission of Inquiry report on the human rights situation in North Korea in February that year.\n\nI have a very special guest in the studio with me this evening. The speaker of the powerful speech that moved the hearts of millions around the world, former South Korean Ambassador to the United Nations Oh Joon is live on News In-depth. He's currently Professor of UN studies at Kyung Hee University and Chair of Save the Children Korea.\nAmbassador Oh, thank you for coming on our show tonight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It's been nearly seven years since that powerful speech of yours that touched the hearts of not just Koreans but all of us across the globe and since the UN Security Council first officially put North Korea's dire human rights situations on its agenda. Six and a half years later, what has been done about the human rights situation in North Korea? What is the situation there like?\n\n To the surprise of many, there was an explicit mention of North Korea's human rights situation in the joint summit statement between Presidents Moon and Biden - that the allies will work together to improve the human rights situation in North Korea. What significance does this hold?\n\n Experts are divided on the summit results with some calling them \"unprecedented achievements\" while others say South Korea gave too much for too little. What's your take, and what struck you the most about the first face-to-face between President Moon and Biden?\n\n While the details of the Biden administration's North Korea policy still remains under the wraps, the two leaders agreed to build efforts on past agreements made in 2018, and President appointed Sung Kim as the new U.S. pointman on North Korea during his joint presser with President Moon.\nSince then, there seem to be some measures being followed up on. Ambassador Sung Kim has been in communication with his South Korean counterpart twice in the last week, NIS chief Park Jie-won flew to New York and Washington. Is the New York channel up and running again? Do you think the North Koreans are up for reengagement with South Korea and the U.S.?\n\n Then, what's next for S. Korea and the U.S. in reengaging North Korea in dialogue?\n\n Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with North Korea's new ambassador to China Ri Ryong Nam on Thursday in Beijing... boasting their traditional ties. This came just five days after the South Korea-U.S. summit took place. What are you reading into this?\n\n President Moon Jae-in, while explaining summit results to the leaders of Korea's major political parties on Wednesday, said that he is in close communication with China on the summit results. Would the summit outcome have a negative impact on future Seoul-Beijing relations? \n\n From expanded cooperation in vaccines, semiconductors and space technology... to mentioning of the Taiwan Strait and the Quad in the joint statement,... there were quite a lot of thorny issues for China to take in. \nHas South Korea ended its strategic ambiguity? What's driving it to tilt towards Washington?\n\n Now to the Quad dilemma. Some say South Korea should limit itself to working group-level participation while others say South Korea will eventually be isolated from regional grouping which could be critical for national security if it doesn't join the forum now. Your take?\n\n Thank you professor Oh for your perspective. Grateful for your expertise.",

As promised, the U.S. will provide South Korea vaccines -- the ones made by Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson.\nAnd in fact, Korea will get almost double the amount of vaccines that Washington originally promised.\n\n(KOREAN - \ub0a8) \n \"Doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, enough for a million people will arrive here this week.

How many vaccines did they do today, and what's the latest on the restrictions?\n\n South Korea today reported four-hundred 80 new cases of COVID-19.\nThis is the first time in almost three weeks that there have been fewer than five hundred, but it should be noted that there are fewer tests done on weekends.\n And the country's vaccination campaign is gathering pace.\nOn Saturday, more than 170-thousand people got their first dose.\nThat means 10-and-a-half percent of the population have received their first dose and over four percent have gotten two doses. \n People are now starting to plan summer vacations, so local governments say they're going to fully open their beaches in July.\nUntil then, though, to prevent crowding, some of the most popular beaches, like Haeundae Beach in Busan, will limit the number of people they admit when they partially open this Tuesday.\nThat's all I have for now.\nBack to you, Connyoung.",

Never seen before.\nAnd this is our growth strategy for the future. Over 30 percent of our recovery package will go to greening our economies\u2026\"\n\nAs some European countries are members of G20 which accounts for 85 percent of global GDP and 80 percent of global emissions, the EU recognized its duty to show leadership.\nGermany, for instance, is working to achieve its national target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.\nGermany also reaffirmed the need for a global approach for a sustainable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n(German) \uc5ec\n\"And we are also prepared to make a fair contribution to a new financing target for the years after 2025, too. Along with the World Bank and other partners, Germany has in addition launched the Green Recovery Initiative, aimed at making the World Bank's economic assistance more sustainable.\"\n\nThe head of the World Economic Forum agreed on the need for a speedy transition toward net zero carbon emissions and laid out a number of goals to respond to climate change.\n\n(English)\n\"First, we need to raise industry ambition even further by supporting companies in all sectors to assess, sharpen and adopt net zero commitments and science-based targets.\"\n\nHe added that ambition should become action and needs to be followed by innovative solutions, aligning private and public finance and investor networks for net-zero, and support for policy as well as political momentum to accomplish carbon neutrality.\n\n(Standup)\nFollowing the leaders' session, there will be a live debate session on Monday... chaired by President Moon.\nThe U.S. special envoy for climate, John Kerry, will be taking part,... and he's expected to deliver a message from President Joe Biden.\nHong Yoo, Arirang News.",

Thanks for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Last month, we saw inflation in the U.S. rise to above four percent. The Fed is still saying clearly that it's going to stick with monetary easing, but some in the market aren't so sure about that. They think conditions could force the Fed to start tapering its bond-buying sooner. What do you make of the situation, professor?\n\n\n\n\n\n Stocks on Wall Street ended higher last week. Right now the S&P is sitting right at where it was a month ago. The U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day. But catch us up on the global markets as we start the week.\n\n\n\n\n\n Here in Korea, it's the last trading day of the month. And today, the markets seemed to lack direction but then both the KOSPI and the KOSDAQ closed higher by almost half a percent. Tell us about the local markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n A couple of broader questions on the economy, professor. Data show production of semiconductors was down in April from the month before. That was the biggest decline in that sector in a year. So I'd like to ask what was behind that move. But also... we see retail sales up in April for a second month in a row, and data showing retailers were more optimistic than they've ever been. What's happening on those two fronts, professor?",

I feel like I wish I could give her a hug because I know what it's like. Like I said, I've been in those positions. We have different personalities, and people are different.\"\n\nBut some of Osaka's contemporaries had questioned her decision not to speak with reporters.\n2019 French Open champion Ashleigh Barty said pressers are part of the job and that tennis players know what they sign up for as professionals.\nThe Roland Garros organizers had previously called Osaka's decision a phenomenal mistake but have since backtracked, wishing the 23 year-old a swift recovery.\n\n(ENGLISH\ub0a8-Reuters 1172)\n\"First and foremost, we are sorry and sad for Naomi Osaka. The outcome of Naomi withdrawing from Roland Garros is unfortunate. We wish her the best and the quickest possible recovery and we look forward to having Naomi in our tournament next year.\"\n\nHad she not forfeited, Osaka was due to face Romania's Ana Bogdan in the second round.\nHan Seong-woo, Arirang News.",

The latest is that athletes will have to sign a COVID-19 waiver to be able to compete. \nWhat can you tell us about that?\n\n That's right. Athletes must sign a waiver which would exempt Olympic organizers from liability for COVID-19 infections.\nCompared to the waivers from previous Olympics, an updated version includes language that protects organizers specifically against consequences of the coronavirus.\nIOC chief operating officer Lana Haddad on Saturday said that the aim is \"to provide transparency and ensure informed consent.\"\nShe also said that the waivers are \"within the framework of the law.\"\nMeanwhile, former South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun has taken issue with the waivers.\nChung said on Sunday that he opposes South Korea's participation in the Tokyo Olympics because the safety and lives of South Korea\u2019s athletes are not guaranteed.\nHe also said that Japan\u2019s Olympic map marking Dokdo as Japanese territory is \u201cobvious political provocation,\" and that the IOC is \u201cdamaging Olympic spirit.\u201d\n\nMoving on to football now, one of the biggest games of club football in the world, the Champions League Final, saw Chelsea emerge as winners?\n\nYes, Chelsea on Saturday lifted the European Champions League after a 1-0 win over Premier League rivals Manchester City.\nGerman midfielder Kai Havertz latched onto a clever through-ball from Mason Mount just a few minutes before half time to score the game\u2019s only goal.\nIt was Chelsea\u2019s second title and leaves City still searching for a major European cup win despite the club spending over one billion U.S. dollars on players over the last five years.\nThis year\u2019s final was moved from Istanbul to Porto due to the UK\u2019s COVID-19 travel restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, the South Korean National Football Team returns to action this weekend for the long-delayed World Cup qualifiers. Who are they playing and what is the current situation?\n\nYes, this Saturday South Korea get their World Cup qualification campaign back underway.\nAfter over a year of delays due to the pandemic, South Korea began training today ahead of three second round World Cup qualifiers.\nUp first is Turkmenistan this Saturday, a team which Korea beat 2-nil in the previous meeting in October 2019.\nSouth Korea have moved top of their group on goal difference\u2026 without even playing.\nThis is because it was announced last Thursday that North Korea\u2019s results were declared null and avoid following their withdrawal.\n\nAnd finally, to baseball. Some good news for domestic baseball fans as the KBO has announced loosened restrictions. What are the changes?\n\nKBO on Monday announced plans to relax social distancing rules on seating arrangements at stadiums during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFans traveling in groups will no longer be required to put unoccupied seats between each other.\nUp to four fans will be allowed to sit in a row if they're attending games as a group.\nThe KBO said it reached the decision following consultations with national health authorities and the sports ministry.\nMeanwhile, in MLB, Ryu Hyun-jin on Saturday helped the Blue Jays beat the Cleveland Indians 11-2 in a game which was cut short by rainstorms in the local area.\nIt was Ryu's fourth win in a row and fourth consecutive match to reach the seventh inning.\n\n Thank-you for that, Paul. We shall see you next week.\n\n Thank-you.",

He joins us from Gland, Switzerland.\nDr. Oberle, it's great to have you with us this evening.\n\n(Gland, Switzerland)\n\n \n\n The IUCN has a diverse role in conserving nature - from biodiversity, ecosystem management, and forests... to governance and rights. Why don't you start by giving us a brief intro about your organization.\n\n You took part in the Green Future Week - in a session on biodiversity restoration. Why is biodiversity conservation one of the most urgent issues in tackling climate change?\n\n In its latest edition of 'The Protected Planet Report,' the UNEP finds the international community has made major progress towards the global target on protected and conserved area coverage, but has fallen far short on its commitments on the quality of these areas - a third of key biodiversity areas on land and the ocean are not protected at all. What more needs to be done, and what kind of a role can a summit like the P4G play in tackling such issues?\n\n The Seoul Declaration will be adopted in just a few hours. What do you hope to see included in the Seoul Declaration and what are your expectations with regards to the level of contribution by each participants?\n\n I'm sure you have been observing various global green discussions with a keen eye. How is the P4G summit different from others, and what significance does it hold?\n\n IUCN Director General Dr. Bruno Oberle joining us live from Zurich. Thank you for your insights.",

It's great to have you with us.\n\n(Geneva) \n \n\n WEF is one of the essential partners of the P4G summit. Could you first tell us about the role of WEF in the summit?\n\n Now, Professor Klaus Schwab, of course, chairman and founder of the World Economic Forum, took part in the leaders' session on day one of the P4G Seoul Summit. What were some of the key takeaways from the leaders' session from the World Economic Forum's point of view?\n\n You participated the P4G summit with a particular focus on the role of the finance industry in the global fight against climate change. What is it and why is it so important?\n\n The world economy was hit hard by the Covid-19 Pandemic with many countries are boosting stimulus measures to keep their economies afloat. How can the world seek post-pandemic economic recovery, and at the same time, continue efforts towards the goal of carbon neutrality?\n\n You gave a keynote speech on the development of green finance models across the globe during the summit here in Seoul. In your observation, which country has set the best example of green finance, and what should we learn from it?\n\n Circular economy has been high on the agenda at the annual World Economic Forum. How do you assess the world's progress thus far in building regenerative economy and minimizing factors harmful to the environment like waste, emission and energy leakage?\n\n What government and civil-level efforts are needed to build a sustainable structure which the circular economy can be built upon?\n\n What has the WEF been doing to tackle climate change, and what are the organization's long-term action plan in the race to zero emissions, and zero waste?\n\n President of the World Economic Forum, Borge Brende live from Geneva for us tonight. Thank you, we deeply appreciate your expertise.",

First of all, how do you assess the progress made since the inaugural summit in Copenhagen in 2018?\n\n Back in 2018, why did Denmark choose South Korea as the host country of the second P4G summit?\nAs we conclude the P4G Seoul Summit, any regrets on the decision you made back three years ago?\n\n What's your assessment of the summit outcome and your key takeaways from the Seoul Declaration?\n\n(\ucf5c\ub86c\ube44\uc544)\n I want to now move on to you, Ambassador Caiza.\n\n The P4G baton has now been handed Bogota, Colombia. When I spoke with South Korea's Climate Ambassador and the Executive Director of the P4G Preparatory Office Yoo Yeonchul earlier this week, not only was it South Korea's wish but as someone who's had an extra year preparing for this summit amid the Covid pandemic, it was also his personal wish that Bogota take the P4G flame to 2023. \nHow do you feel to be hosting and preparing for the 2023 P4G Bogota Summit for the next two years and what do you take away from the Seoul Declaration?\n\n We heard from your president in the Leaders' Dialogue. Colombia has been contributing to the world's race towards zero emissions, adopting national environmental campaigns like 'My Carbon footprint'. Tell us more about Colombia's efforts towards carbon neutrality, and what are its priorities in the fight against climate change?\n\n Professor Chung, from South Korea's perspective...\n\n(\uc815\uc11c\uc6a9 \uad50\uc218)  \n How do you evaluate South Korea's role in leading this year's P4G Summit? Do you think it has successfully positioned itself as one of global leaders in the world's fight against climate change?\n\n Does South Korea have a unique edge in playing a role as a bridge between developing and developed economies in achieving inclusive green recovery towards carbon neutrality?\n\n(\ub374\ub9c8\ud06c) \n Ambassador Christensen, Denmark and South Korea both share a role in bridging the gap between the developed and the developing world in the battle against climate change. U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry committed to doubling climate finance to developing nations by 2024. Are South Korea and Denmark doing enough?\n\n(\uc815\uc11c\uc6a9)\n Professor Chung, do we have the political will and commitment to act now to keep global warming within the 1-point-5 degree threshold? \n\n(\ucf5c\ub86c\ube44\uc544)\n\n Ambassador Caiza, many point to lack of participation by larger economies as the limit of P4G summit. For future reference of the next host country, Colombia, what areas of this year's summit could have been better, and how can the summit be further enhanced? \n\n(\uacf5\ud1b5\uc9c8\ubb38)\n And this is for all three of you: in your view, what is one of the most important and urgent challenges that need our immediate attention or action? Let me start with you, Ambassador Christensen.\n\nProfessor Chung.\n\nAmbassador Caiza.\n\n(\uacf5\ud1b5\uc9c8\ubb38)\n(\ub374\ub9c8\ud06c) \n I'd like to end by hearing your thoughts on the Troika system --- As I mentioned, South Korea's Climate Ambassador Yoo Yeonchul told me about the Denmark-South Korea-Colombia Troika system to carry on the P4G spirit. Ambassador Christensen, how do you plan to work with these two countries in carrying on the legacy of the summit?\n\n(\uc815\uc11c\uc6a9)\n What kind of a role do you believe Seoul can play in keeping this Troika up and running, Professor Chung?\n\n(\ucf5c\ub86c\ube44\uc544)\n Ambassador Caiza, how does Bogota plan to make full use of this Troika system for a successful P4G Bogota in 2023 and what are Colombia's deliverables for the Bogota summit?\n\n Ambassador Tomas Anker CHRISTENSEN, Climate Ambassador of Denmark, Ambassador Juan Carlos CAIZA Rosero of Colombia and Professor Chung Suh yong of Korea University... thank you all for a productive discussion tonight. We appreciate it. And, best of luck to Bogota!",

We want to reach by 2030 a reduction of 51 percent in our C02 emissions. \nAnd we have committed ourselves to reach by 2050 carbon neutrality.\u201d\n\nThe South American country pledged to make efforts through electric vehicles, renewable energy transition and clean mobility.\nThe President of European Commission announced the EU's ambition to be the first carbon neutral continent by 2050.\n\n(English)\n\u201c2020s is the make or break decade and that's why Europe is committed to reduce our emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.\u201d\n\nShe praised President Moon for his plan to update the NDC ahead of COP26, saying it would inspire South Korea's international partners.\n The U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, emphasized that countries should step up their ambitions to reduce the Earth's temperature by 1-point-5 degrees and praised South Korea for joining such efforts.\nHe also revealed the steps his country would take to support developing countries in responding to climate change.\n\n(English)\n\u201cSo we will double our public climate finance to developing countries by 2024 or sooner.\nWe will work to achieve the 100 billion and in addition we are working with the private sector to bring literally trillions of dollars to the table now for investment in climate related initiatives.\u201d\n\nWrapping up the P4G Seoul Summit, President Moon said he hoped it served as an opportunity to expand global cooperation to ensure a coordinated response to the climate crisis.\nHong Yoo, Arirang News.",

The result has been pretty disappointing, because in most cases, in most cities, young couples, when they get married, they plan to have one child or no children at all.\"\n\nHe added real incentives are needed as financial pressures are already huge.\nFor nearly 40 years, the Chinese government imposed a 'one-child policy',... which was eased amid concerns about an ageing workforce. \nAccording to a recent Chinese census, the country's population grew at its slowest pace since the 1950s during the last 10 years,... to one-point-four-one-billion.\nAlso, last year, the birthrate was recorded at just one-point-three children per woman,... the same level as ageing societies including Japan and Italy.",

Bringing you some of the most interesting news from around the globe, I'm Eum Ji-young.\nMany countries are striving to halt declining birth rates,... and the world's most populous nation is no exception. \nChina will now allow married couples to have up to three children,... marking a departure from its previous two-child limit. \nBut after the announcement on Monday, critics say that this policy shift is in fact not enough to turn the nation's birthrate around. \n\n(ENGLISH-\ub0a8)\n\"Well, in 2015, so five or six years ago, the government already relaxed the family planning policy, and to allow couples to have two children. The result has been pretty disappointing, because in most cases, in most cities, young couples, when they get married, they plan to have one child or no children at all.\"\n\nHe added real incentives are needed as financial pressures are already huge.\nFor nearly 40 years, the Chinese government imposed a 'one-child policy',... which was eased amid concerns about an ageing workforce. \nAccording to a recent Chinese census, the country's population grew at its slowest pace since the 1950s during the last 10 years,... to one-point-four-one-billion.\nAlso, last year, the birthrate was recorded at just one-point-three children per woman,... the same level as ageing societies including Japan and Italy.",

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during the agency's annual ministerial assembly on Monday,... said the WHO is facing a \"serious challenge\" to maintain its COVID-19 response at the current level,... and he called for more ambitious reforms.\nHealth ministers also called for reforms to strengthen the capacity of both the WHO and their respective countries to contain new viruses in the future.\n Under a resolution submitted by the EU,... and adopted by consensus,... member states will lead the reforms through a year-long process.\nMinisters from the WHO's 194 member states will also meet in November to decide whether to launch negotiations on a pandemic treaty.\nLee Seung-jae, Arirang News.",

Thanks for coming on today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n The U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday for Memorial Day. In Europe stocks were down for the day, but they did well for the month. Asian Stocks today kind of a mix. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n \n\n\n\n A lot of international organizations and the Korean government itself have been raising their growth forecast for the local economy, and the latest one to do so is the OECD. It's calling for growth of 3-point-8 percent now, and increase of half a point. How do you think all this optimism is factoring into the markets?\n\n \n\n\n\n Oil prices are up today by about one percent, with demand expected to rise... and outstrip supply in the second half of this year. And another commodity, gold, is up too for a third day. What do you see happening with these commodities?\n\n \n\n\n\n And if we could look at cryptocurrencies for a minute. Bitcoin has seen a little bounce back up from it's recent low, but of course it's still down almost 40 percent from where it was in early May. Where do you see cryptos going from here?",

They're being directed to the reserve forces, the civil defence corps, as well as people planning overseas business trips or diplomatic missions over the age of 30. They're all civilians here in South Korea. That's because there are safety concerns over rare blood clots which prompted the Korean government to recommend against the use of Janssen vaccine for under-30s and most of the nation's armed forces are under the age of 30. What's your safety assessment of the one-shot vaccine? \n\n Instead, the roughly 440-thousand members of the South Korean forces will be receiving Pfizer's Covid-19 shots in mid-June. It makes us wonder whether it's safe for the rest of us especially for those of us in the 30s and perhaps even in early to mid 40s to take the AstraZeneca or the Johnson and Johnson shots. \n\n Starting today, over 3.7 million Koreans who received the first shot of covid vaccine can meet their family members regardless of the number of gathering people. What are your thoughts on easing of gathering ban restrictions on vaccinated people?\n\n The EU is planning to lift quarantine rules for the vaccinated people in the bloc in time for the summer holiday season. Vaccine passport will be adopted rom July 1 which will make the passport holders to travel around freely within Europe without going through testing or quarantine. The UK will be excluded due to the spread of the Indian variant. \nWhat are the prerequisites for a safe and effective implementation of vaccine passport?\n\n Dr. Alice Tan, as always many thanks for your insights and expertise. We appreciate it.",

It designated the Financial Services Commission, which you were once part of, as the key institution. What are the key points here?\n\n In addition to the government measures... several bills have also been proposed at the National Assembly to regulate the cryptomarket. What issues are the bills designed to address, and what are the biggest concerns surrounding those bills? \n\n The government measures include imposing tax on capital gains from cryptocurrency transactions beginning next year. What are the pros and cons of taxing cryptocurrency transactions?\n\n On the other hand, the Science and ICT ministry will help promote blockchain technology and foster related industries. So, the government is aiming to boost blockchain technology to better regulate the cryptocurrency market. Help us better understand. \n\n U.S. regulators have also recently hinted at taking on a bigger role in the hyped-up cryptocurrency market. U.S. and South Korea have been seen as the more adaptive countries to cryto and its technology. These two countries are stepping up regulations. What are your thoughts? Still are there differences between the approaches by these two countries and how about compared with other major economies?\n\n Authorities have called cryptocurrency as \"intangible assets\" and said that it was a misunderstanding to label them as currencies. In your perspective, can they be considered as \"real assets\"?\n\n Chairman Lee Jong-gu (\uc774\uc885\uad6c) at the Korea Blockchain Association's self-regulatory commitee for us tonight.

Abbey.\n\nJee: Hi Sunhee. \nYou are absolutely right about Korea ramping up its vaccination efforts. \n So far this week, 12-point-4 percent of the country's population... received at least one dose. \nThat\u2019s about FIVE AND A HALF MILLION people. \n Around 75 percent of those over the age of SIXTY... have also booked their vaccine appointments. \nDuring Tuesday\u2019s regular briefing, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency addressed concerns regarding the side effects of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines in particular. Let\u2019s take a listen... to the K-D-C-A Commissioner.\n\n(Briefing) \n For both AstraZeneca and Pfizer, the number of reported side effects is higher among young people compared to the elderly. When looking at the number of post-inoculation deaths, there have been similar occurrences in the UK and other countries abroad, while no meaningful differences between the two vaccines have been observed. \n\n You may be wondering what this is in reference to. \nThe remark follows the first case of a vaccine-induced low blood platelet count. A man in his thirties,... who HAD A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION... of cerebral hemorrhage and other health issues... was hospitalised earlier this month. He received treatment after suffering a convulsion,... that was not life-threatening.\n\n Hope he recovers soon.\nSo what does the government plan to do... to ease public concerns?\n \n The K-D-C-A head said\u2026 the agency plans to compensate for the damages in a prompt manner. She emphasized that low blood platelet count... is a treatable condition when detected early and with proper care. \n She urged the public to seek medical advice when experiencing a severe headache or persistent stomach ache within FOUR to TWENTY EIGHT days of inoculation. Jeong also reminded medical institutions to double-check patients' history of medication when they shows symptoms... and to treat them accordingly to the national guidelines. \n\n Now... ABBEY... there are reports... over in the US... of men... in their THIRTIES... suffering from inflammation... in their heart MUSCLES... after vaccination.\nWhat is the K-D-C-A's response? \n\n JEE: That's right. \nIn the U.S. and Israel,... there have been reports of Myocarditis from the younger male demographic... after receiving Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Research on the possible link between vaccinations and this health condition... is still ongoing... and yet to be confirmed. \n\n Before you go... I understand there is a growing speculation... over the ORIGIN... of the coronavirus?\n\n Sure. \nDue to the lack of information available on the first several known cases of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, among other roadblocks, scientists are urging for more data from Beijing. \n A group of leading scientists around the world said... the theory that it was caused by a laboratory leak... needs to be taken seriously until there is a RIGOROUS data-led investigation that proves it wrong.\nStanford University's David Relman, who co-authored a letter in SCIENCE MAGAZINE for a look into the possibility said... the demand for thorough research doesn't equate to taking a shot at the Chinese government. \n\n(SOUNDBITE Edit No: 5129) (English) \n \"When we talk about the possibility of a lab accident, we are not necessarily talking about anything deliberate. We're not necessarily talking about the engineering of a new virus. This could be as simple as a laboratory seeking to grow viruses from important samples, bat samples, not realizing that one of them contained Sars-CoV-2.\"\n\nExperts say understanding how and where the virus originated is CRUCIAL to preventing another pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak has taken more than 3-and-a-half million lives around the world so far. That's all from me today.",

A success? And what did it mean for South Korea?\nLet's talk about it on News In-depth tonight. \nI have a group of diplomatic and political experts joining me from London, Washington and right here in our Seoul studio. \nIn the studio with me is Woo Jung-yeop, Director of the Center for American Studies at the Sejong Institute. Good to have you with us.\nAnd, from London, Tim Bale, Professor of Politics at Queen Mary University of London and from Michigan, Ambassador Mark Lippert, vice presidnt for international affairs at Boeing. Ambassador Lippert was the U.S. Ambassador to South Korea under President Obama.\nThank you gentlement for joining us.\n\n\n\n(London, UK)\n\n\n(Michigan, U.S.)\n\n\n\n (BALE) The G7 Cornwall came to a close with the overall mood positive all throughout: America's allies were visibly relieved to have the US back as an engaged international player after the last four years.\nFrom hosting the summit to selection of guests and finally the communique, how would you rate the success of the G7 Cornwall, Professor Bale?\n\n (LIPPERT) The meeting the G7 did put out a communique and the U.S. President had the been interested in getting strong language against China in the joint statement. The language on China in the final communique is more muted than what the U.S. has used and it was apparent not every European power views China in as harsh a light as Biden. Did Mr. Biden get what he wanted from the G7 Summit?\n\n (WOO) What about South Korea? What was in it for South Korean President Moon Jae-in and what was South Korea able to get out from the beachside summit in southwestern England this year?\n(Significance of S. Korea's attendance at the G7) \n\n (LIPPERT) U.S. President Biden defined the fundamental struggle in the post-pandemic era as being democracies versus autocracies. The joint communique was signed only by the members of G7 with the exception of the Open Societies Statement -- directed at China and Russia. It was signed by the four invitees as well -- whom British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called \"Democracies 11.\"\nIs there a message that's being conveyed by this? Does this in anyway put South Korea in a bit of a difficult position?\n\n** Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a phone conversation with Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong on the eve of the G7 summit, slammed Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy and quite bluntly urged Seoul not to be misled and adhere to the 'correct position'.***\n\n (BALE) The G7 leaders pledged to set up yet another working group to design an infrastructure aid program dubbed Build Back Better for the World -- aimed at countering China's Belt and Road Initiative.\nHow realistic is this initiative?\n\n (WOO) For South Korea, China wasn't the only elephant in the room. Seoul had anticipated at least a pull aside with Tokyo as it would be the very first in-person meeting between President Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga since Suga took office. Not only did that not happen, a trilateral with President Biden in presence did not take place, either. It looked like the venue itself offered a perfect setting for a quick informal even away from the camera chats between leaders. Would that have been so difficult?\n\n (LIPPERT) And, we're learning today that, although not a formal bilateral summit, a pull aside had been planned between President Moon and Prime Minister Suga, but the Japanese side ended up cancelling at the G7 summit, last minute. Ambassador Lippert, you're no stranger to diplomatic protocols. This can't be common practice? What does this say about Seoul, Tokyo relations? \n\n (COMMON) Key takeaway from the 2021 G7 Cornwall Summit. \nLet me start with you, Professor Bale.\n\nAmbassador Lippert.\n\nAnd, Dr. Woo.\n\n Professor Tim Bale, Ambassador Mark Lippert and Dr. Woo Jung-yeop, thank you all for sharing your insights with us. I appreciate it.",

We ask holiday-goers to check in advance how congested the beaches are.\"\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea will run a three-level alert system - green, yellow and red - to warn tourists of congestion at beaches.\nThe system applies to all 277 beaches in the country and data on how crowded they are will be available on Naver and Kakao.\nThose going to large beaches will be given special stickers that change color when body temperatures hover above 37.5 degrees Celsius.\nAt smaller beaches, travelers will be given wristbands to show their temperatures have been checked.\nA reservation system for beach-goers will also be expanded from 13 beaches in Jeollanam-do Province last year to 50 spots across the country in 2021.\nAnd amid growing concerns that scanning QR codes may lead to personal information leaks, visitors will be able to \"check-in\" by dialing a designated phone number at each beach. \nHan Seong-woo, Arirang News.",

I have Jang Tae-hyun (\uc7a5\ud0dc\ud604)... here... in the studio.\nWelcome... Tae-hyun (\ud0dc\ud604).\n\n Good afternoon.\n\n Right... then... let's start... with the LATEST... at schools... here in Seoul.\n\n Sure. So starting from June 14,... middle-school students in the capital region... will be able to attend school more often.\n The education ministry announced Wednesday... that the attendance cap for middle schools in Seoul,... will be raised to two-thirds of their capacity,... from the current one-third.\nThe decision reflects the ministry's view... that remote learning is not an ideal substitute... for in-person classes.\nThe education MINISTER said student learning had suffered... as a result of school disruptions triggered by the pandemic. \nDespite the partial resumption of in-person classes,... the country has held only half the number of face-to-face classes... compared to a normal school year.\n Middle schools in the capital region... were hardest hit by the attendance cap,... facing greater restrictions in accordance to level two social distancing.\nThe pandemic has also affected the mental well-being of students,... with more pupils reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nBut,... better days could lie ahead,... especially for students at vocational schools,... where they learn hands-on skills like auto-repair.\nThat's because students there... will be able to attend daily classes... as part of the eased restrictions later this month.\nI visited one of those schools... to talk to some of the teachers,... and this is what they had to say.\n\n(English) \n \"Especially, in this kind of laboratory, we need to hold in-person classes. Based on the online classes, it's very difficult to deliver our instruction and training to students.\"\n\n(Korean) \n \"Helping students obtain their certificates is our main goal as instructors. It would be beneficial if students can come early to practice and prepare,... but that is difficult under the current circumstances. So as a teacher,... I support the full resumption of in-person classes.\"\n\n And... I'm sure... parents... like me... SUPPORT... that... TOO.\nNOW... EARLIER... you spoke of... the psychological repercussions... of the pandemic... AND... I hear... authorities have a plan... to BETTER ADDRESS... them?\n\n They do,... because the mental health effects are continuing to snowball,... as the pandemic drags on. \n According to a survey conducted by the health ministry this March,... the number of people at RISK of depression... has jumped to 23 percent of the population this year,... up from just 4 percent in 2018.\nYoung people in their twenties and thirties were at the greatest risk,... with nearly 1 in 3 showing early signs of depression.\nAnd the survey showed... that women are more likely to feel the blues and anxiety... than men.\n So,... health authorities decided to offer online counseling services... targeting young people.\nA 24-hour hotline and in-person consultations will also be available... for those working at designated COVID-19 treatment centers.\nPatients who are being treated at these facilities... can also receive counseling,... even after recovery,... if needed.\n\n That's COMFORTING... to know.\nTae-hyun (\ud0dc\ud604)... let's SHIFT... our SCENERY... a bit\nSummer is around the corner... and... authorities are looking... to BOOST PREVENTION MEASURES... at the beach? \n\n Absolutely. Health authorities are leaving nothing to chance,... especially with beaches expected to welcome far more visitors... compared to last year. Take a listen.\n\n(Korean) \n \"The number of beach visitors fell 60 percent on-year in 2020. But this year,... we're expecting a rebound in that number thanks to vaccinations... so accordingly,... we have drafted new set of preventive guidelines for beaches.\"\n\n People can call a designated number on their mobile phones to check-in,... instead of using QR codes or hand-written visitor logs.\nA 'temperature sticker' will be put on the visitors... on their wrist or on the back of their hand,... to check for any fevers.\nIf anyone has a temperature of over 37-point-five degrees Celsius,... the color of the sticker will change,... and he or she will have to be isolated... at a nearby community health center.\n Everyone is required... to wear a mask at all times,... only except when they are in the water. \nVisitors are also advised... not to eat or drink... especially during the evening hours.\nPeople can check how crowded the beaches are... in real-time,... using platforms like Naver or Kakao.\nSo, it's best to use these services before hitting the beach,... and avoid places that are too crowded.\n\n Alright. Thank you for the coverage.\n\n My pleasure.",

After more than a decade and seven years since the first launch of the KSLV-I or Naro in 2013. The Naro, eight year ago, was launched partially with Russian technology. \nWhen the KSLV-II, complete fully with Korea's homegrown technology, is successfully launched into space come October, how big of leap forward is this from the Naro space rocket eight years ago?\n\n One notable aspect of the rocket launch, is that the launch pad was attached to what's called an 'umbilical tower' for the first time in Korea's history. What purpose does it serve, and why is it important?\n\n If the launch is a success in October, South Korea will become only the seventh country in the world to obtain independent space launch vehicle technology. What will this mean for Korea's aerospace industry?\n\n South Korea is a relative latecomer to the global space development race. Where do we stand in the global realm? Is South Korea catching up relatively quickly?\n \n What were some of the biggest challenges for the Korea Aerospace Research Institute and for you, personally, in building this rocket?\n   \n Does the latest agreement with the United States on civil space cooperation help South Korea's space development? How will joining the Artemis Project and the lifting of South Korea's missile range limit impact your future goals in space?\n\n Dr. Han Sang-yeop(\ud55c\uc0c1\uc5fd) at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute for us tonight. Thank you, and we very much look forward to the successful launching of \"Nuri\".",

I have in the studio with me our senior North Korea analyst, Dr. Go Myong-hyun.\nDr. Go, as always, thank you for being with us this evening.\n \n\n\n So, what are you reading into North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's one, creation of this 'first secretary' post? Is this really a second in command in a regime where up until now, most of us have believed there could not be a second, third, or fourth in command, but just the one and absolutely commander in chief?\n\n Some speculate the position could be vacant or occupied by Jo Yong-won or Kim Tok-hun. They're known to be two of the most powerful men outside of the Kim family in the regime. \nDo you agree? Who are they?\n\n Wouldn't Kim Jong-un's powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong be a more likely choice?\nBut, then there are those who argue that only members of the Politburo Standing Committee would be eligible for the new role... which of course would rule out the possibility of Kim Yo-jong as although she does have influence \"comparable to the second-most powerful person in North Korea,\" she does not occupy a high rank in the WPK.\n\n Weren't there reports several months ago that the North Korean leader had delegated some of his official duties to his sister -- to oversee \"general state affairs\" --- to ease his workload? Could this be part of his burden-sharing initiatives?\n\n North Korea released its first response to the Moon-Biden summit, and it was centered on the lifting of restrictions that had been imposed on South Korea's missiles for the past four decades. North Korea warned that it would raise tensions on the Korean Peninsula and trigger an arms race. How do you analyze the level of hostility reflected in the response, and would it impact future Pyeongyang-Washington relations?\n\n North Korea also said that \"many countries\" are noticing that the Biden administration's use of terms like 'pragmatic approach' or 'maximum flexibility' for its North Korea policy... are nothing but a scheme. (\"\uad8c\ubaa8\uc220\uc218\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud558\ub2e4\") But experts say that this doesn't indicate North Korea's negative stance on Biden's policy, but rather it shows a possibility that the North may be holding backroom talks with the U.S. for official dialogue. Your thoughts?\n\n South Korea-U.S. joint military drills are set for August, and it will likely be one of the determining factors for the resumption of Pyeongyang-Washington talks. How do you foresee things to pan out from this point on?\n\n Dr. Go Myong-hyun, as always, many thanks for your insights. We appreciate it.",

        "artcl_ctt": "South Korea this week revealed an exciting glimpse of the country's first ever homegrown space rocket, the Nuri.\nIt was the first time that a model of the fully assembled KSLV-2 has been revealed -- 11 years after scientists began developing the three-stage rocket.\nIts launch in October would make South Korea the seventh country in the world to secure its own technology for space launch vehicles,... enabling it to actively join global efforts to explore and expand into the 'final frontier,' particularly now that Seoul and Washington have inked agreements to bolster space cooperation.\nTo illuminate the future of space exploration for South Korea and the international community, I'm joined by Yoo Joonkoo, Research Professor of the Center for International Law, Korea National Diplomatic Academy and Michelle L.D. Hanlon, Co-Director of Air and Space Law at the University of Mississippi and Co-founder of For All Moonkind.\n\n1. Professor Yoo: The launch of Nuri is just a couple of months away now, and after that, South Korea will also launch its first robotic lunar exploration mission, Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) next summer. What are the country's goals for moon exploration and how far along are they?\n\n2. Dr. Hanlon: What do you see as being both the significance and potential of South Korea's homegrown space rocket?\n\n3. Professor Yoo: Last week, South Korea became the 10th country to join the Artemis Accords, a U.S.-led agreement that sets out principles for a peaceful space exploration. What is the significance of South Korea joining this initiative and signing the Artemis Accords?\n\n4. Dr. Hanlon: What does the Artemis Accords stand for, and what does partaking in the Artemis Accords mean for South Korea? \n\n\n5. Professor Yoo: How do you expect South Korea and the U.S. will deepen their space cooperation? Which areas do you think have the most potential for collaboration? What does South Korea have to offer?\n\n\n6.  How do you expect South Korea and the U.S. to collaborate in space? What can South Korea bring to the table?\n\n7. Dr. Hanlon: Earlier this year, there were reports that China and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding to build an \u201cInternational Lunar Research Station\u201d (ILRS).  What impact could this joint effort have on the United States and on international security?\n\n8. Professor Yoo: Also, South Korea and the United States signed an agreement for cooperation on \u201ccivil global navigation satellite systems,\u201d under which the U.S. will support development of South Korea's own satellite navigation system. What is the importance of boosting national GPS capability for Korea\u2019s security as well as commercial technology?\n\nThat was Yoo Joonkoo, Research Professor of the Center for International Law, Korea National Diplomatic Academy and Michelle L.D. Hanlon, Space Lawyer, and Co-founder of For All Moonkind. Thank you for your time.\n(Seoul)\n\n(Connecticut) - \ub179\ud654",

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged an additional 800 million U.S. dollars to the COVAX Facility,... aiming for a fairer distribution of vaccines worldwide.\nThe announcement came during an online vaccine summit Wednesday,... co-hosted by Japan and the Gavi vaccine alliance,... a group that promotes vaccinations in developing nations.\nSuga said more solidarity and commitment is needed to overcome the crisis,... adding Japan will fully support the safe, fair and effective distribution of vaccines to as many people around the world as it can.\n Japan's latest contribution brings its total contribution to one billion dollars.\nLee Seung-jae, Arirang News.",

From our perspective, Bitcoin\u2019s price gains have been excessive.\n\nCrytocurrencies are digital assets... that are based on blockchains... otherwise known as digital ledgers.\n\nCrytocurrency\nDigital assets that are stored in encrypted ledgers\n\nCrytocurrencies typically make use of decentralized network,... and are not issued by central banks and other state financial institutions.\n\nPARK Sang-jun, Director / Blockchain Research Center, Dongguk University\nA typical crytocurrency is characterized by three unique factors. The first is its application of P2P blockchain technology, and the second is its use of crytography to verify its authenticity.\nWhen assets are digitized, we also need a digital standard to denote the value of those assets. That is the role being played by crytocurrency and you can also say that digital coins therefore hold actual value. \n\nThe booming crytocurrency market... has attracted many investors looking to strike gold.\n\nIn April,... more than 2 million new users signed up... for membership on Korea\u2019s four largest crytpo exchanges... compared to only around 20,000 in March of last year.\n\nSeung-joo Gabriel KIM, Professor / School of Cybersecurity, Korea University\nThe market is overheating, that\u2019s for sure. Young people in their 20s and 30s here in Korea have been the main players in the latest crypto investment frenzy, likely due to anxiety over what they perceive to be dwindling opportunities to acquire wealth.\n\nKorea isn\u2019t the only country... where people are jumping on the crytocurrency bandwagon.\n\nThe exponential rise in trading volume... in major crytocurrency exchanges all across the world,... is clear indication that the crypto wave has gone global. \n\nAnd according to experts,... the COVID-19 pandemic may have played an important role... in fueling the latest boom in digital coins.\n\nExperts say cryptocurrency boom partly fueled by COVID-19\n\nKIM Jin-ill, Professor / Department of Economics, Korea University\nThe COVID-19 pandemic triggered a huge influx of liquidity in Korea and countries across the world as governments sought to overcome the crisis through fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe world has also further embraced digital, contactless technology, which is further fueling demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \n\nThe crytocurrency market cooled off... and went through a large correction,... as the calendar turned to May.\n\nThe pullback in cryptocurrency prices... was also triggered... following moves by financial authorities in China and the US to tighten digital currency regulations.\n\nDespite the emergence of bearish sentiments,... new investments are continuing to flow into digital tokens. \n\nKIM Jin-ill, Professor / Department of Economics, Korea University\nNo investment is completely risk-free. Even the spare change in your pocket can lose value when there\u2019s inflation. It comes down to each individual to decide how they should diversify their assets.\n\nPARK Sang-jun, Director / Blockchain Rsearch Center, Dongguk University\nYou should do your own research on the crytocurrency you want to invest in to determine whether or not it\u2019s a sound investment. Don\u2019t just follow someone else\u2019s advice. If it promises massive returns, it is likely to be a scam. You need to develop the right intuition to see into the growth potential of a given cryptocurrency in order to get a steady return on your investment.\n\nThe persistent buzz surrounding cryptocurrency,... is likely to spark further debate... on what the future holds for these digital tokens.",

Thanks for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n The latest Beige Book from the Fed shows the U.S. economy picking up in the past couple of months. It seems there's also more upward pressure on prices, including the price of lower-wage labor. This is the kind of thing that's been fueling talk of the Fed tapering its bond-buying. Tell us about the Beige Book and what it means?\n\n\n\n\n\n Stocks on Wall Street were higher Wednesday ahead of jobs data for May. Investors are also pumping the so-called meme stocks again, like AMC movie theaters. Tell us about that, and the overall story in the global markets?\n\n\n\n\n\n Korean stocks were higher today too. We can see a renewed interest in local SPAC offerings. What's happening here in domestic stocks?\n\n\n\n\n\n Last month, data show consumer prices in Korea were up 2-point-6 percent from a year earlier. That was the biggest on-year rise in nine years. In large part because of higher grocery prices, but oil prices also a factor since they were so low a year ago. The government thinks this will settle down later in the year. But what do you make of the concerns out there about inflation?\n\n\n\n\n\n There's talk now in South Korea's ruling Democratic Party about the need for a possible second extra budget this year to fund more support for people who are self-employed and others who've been hit by the pandemic. But again this would have to be funded by debt, and again there's the inflation issue. What do you make of the situation, professor?",

Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia, said on Thursday that they saw record U.S. sales last month for the third month in a row.\nThe two companies sold more than 170-thousand cars in May... following more than 150-thousand in April, and 144-thousand in March.\nHyundai sold about 90-thousand cars and Kia about 80-thousand, (\ubb34\ube59) up 56 percent and 75 percent respectively compared to the same period the previous year.\nOf Hyundai's figures, the sales of eco-friendly cars soared 887-percent... accounting for 11 percent of their total retail sales.\nAn industry watcher says he sees an even brighter outlook for EV sales in the U.S.\n\n(Korean-\ub0a8) - \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc788\ub294 \uc804\ud654\uc778\ud130\ubdf0\n\"U.S. already has a lot of public EV charging stations... and its not just the public infrastructure... many people have realized the convenience of charging their cars at home. So as these people tell others how convenient it is, more people start buying electric cars.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Kia unveiled its first all-electric vehicle, the EV6... the first model to use Kia's EV-dedicated platform.\nAt a showcase in Seoul, Kia unveiled three EV6 models: standard, GT-Line, and GT.\nThe standard model offers two choices of battery packs... standard and long-range.\nThe long-range battery allows the vehicle to travel 20 kilometers further than Hyundai's IONIQ 5 on a single charge.\n\n(Korean-\ub0a8) \n\"The long-range model allows drivers to travel up to 450 kilometers on a single charge using a 77-point-4 kilowatt-hour battery. It can also travel more than a hundred kilometers with just 4 and a half minutes of charging.\"\n\nThe EV6 will go on sale in all 50 states across the U.S. in early 2022.\nAs for Korea, the standard and GT-Line models of EV6 will be released in July... and the GT model will come out in the second half of next year.\nBae Eun-ji, Arirang News.",

South Korea's consumer prices hit the highest in over nine years last month, posting 2.6% on-year growth. What was the reason behind this?\n\n Authorities and experts remain divided on the big spike in consumer prices, with some saying the inflationary pressure is only temporary, while others are seeing it as a serious warning. \nBut Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki projected the pressure to alleviate in the second half of the year. \nWhat's your projection? \n\n The latest consumer price index places more pressure on the Bank of Korea to raise the interest rate, and many in fact predict a rate hike by the end of this year. \nWhen do you think is the right time for a rate hike?\n\n The government is gearing up to hand out another round of disaster relief funds in time for the summer holiday season. \nThe ruling party is largely pushing for aid-to-all policy, while the finance ministry is sticking to a selective handout. \nIs another round of relief funds critical for economic recovery, and do you think they should be distributed to all citizens?\n\n Distributing disaster relief funds to all citizens is estimated to cost roughly 12 point 6 billion U.S. dollars\nwhich will likely be included in this year's second supplementary budget. \nHow could this impact South Korea's fiscal health? \n\n South Korea's foreign exchange reserves hit an all-time high again reaching over 456 billion U.S. dollars last month. \nWhat factors led the increase, and what does this mean to the Korean economy?\n\n Thank you Professor. Yang, as always, for your insights. Grateful for your expertise.",

        "artcl_ctt": "If you thought BTS couldn\u2019t get any bigger, it seems the sky's the limit for this South Korean boyband's popularity.\nDebuting at No. 1 for the fourth time on the U.S. charts with its brand new hit single 'Butter', scooping up a four Billboard awards last week, and featuring in the biggest U.S. talk shows, McDonald's meals around the world and the cover of Rolling Stone -- the first all-Asian act to do so in the magazine's 54-year history -- BTS is painting the world pastel. \nThe hype around them clearly goes beyond their catchy tunes. \nWe look at the group's acclaimed status, their influence on fans, society and culture amid the continuing rise of K-pop.\nFor this, we connect with Rani Neutill, an essayist and lecturer of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Harvard University and, Affiliate Faculty in Writing, Literature, and Publishing at Emerson College\nWe also connect with David Tizzard, Professor of Politics, Seoul Women's University.\n\n1. Rani: You said that you are a new member of ARMY, and that BTS has \"created an alternate world that you just want to escape to, particularly now\". What first drew you to the fan base and what kept you hooked? \n\n2. Rani: BTS have won the social artist title several times at U.S. award shows, proving their success goes beyond just their showmanship.  You've said that their popularity \"also lies in their ability to be vulnerable [and] intimate\" in the relationships they forged with their fans through social media.\" How has their influence affected fans?\n\n3. David: K-pop is no longer only consumed by Korean fans; you have also pointed out that the meanings and intentions of K-pop songs and videos are now \"dissected and generated\" by millions of non-Korean fans overseas. How has the globalisation of K-pop changed the industry?\n\n4. David: The popularity of bands like BTS appear to be sparking discussions on a number of social and cultural issues such as the desexualization of Asian men, mental health, social engagement of artists and more. In your view, what is the most prominent impact that the rise of K-Pop groups have had particularly in the West?\n\n5. Rani: BTS has donated over 1 million U.S. dollars to the Black Lives Matter movement and have also promoted a mental awareness campaign, LOVE MYSELF, at the UN. Has their engagement in social issues inspired their fans even more, and do you feel that you are more dedicated to the fandom through such meaningful causes?\n\n6. David: You have called K-pop groups the \"goose with the golden eggs\" for the Korean economy. How much further do you think the current model of the K-pop industry can sustain, or will they have to make some changes to stay competitive and appealing?\n\n7. Rani: The music industry in the U.S. is dominated by songs in English, and BTS has faced some racism and \"colonialist attitudes [regarding music]\" that you've also pointed out. Do you see the music industry changing and evolving away from these attitudes with the rise of non-American bands singing in languages other than English such as BTS?\n\n8. David: With regards to the success of BTS and other K-pop groups, most of the focus has been on their achievements in North America and Europe. But a recent study of the ARMY fan base that surveyed more than 400,000 fans showed that the most prominent source of support for BTS was from countries such as Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. You have pointed out that this is a reinforcement of established hegemonic cultural positions. Could you elaborate?\n\nThat's where we have to leave it for today. Rani Neutill, essayist and lecturer of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Harvard University,...and David Tizzard, Professor of Politics, Seoul Women's University, thank you both for your time.\n\n(Massachusettes)\n\n(Seoul) - \ub179\ud654",

Moon said he was sorry for what he called an \"evil practice\" in barracks culture and said he will get to the bottom of it.\n\n(\uc790\ub9c9)\n  \"I am very sorry to the people that this evil practice in the barracks culture led to a tragic and unjust death.

Moon also reaffirmed his commitment to revitalizing the peace process,... pledging to prepare for the Korean Peninsula to take a big step toward denuclearization and peace.\n He recalled his recent summit with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House -- saying that the allies agreed to elevate ties to a comprehensive alliance... based on peace and prosperity... and democracy and human rights.\n\n(\uc790\ub9c9)\n \"[President Biden and I] shared the understanding that dialogue and diplomacy are the only way to achieve denuclearization and permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.

Moon said he was sorry for what he called an \"evil practice\" in barracks culture and said he will get to the bottom of it.\n\n(\uc790\ub9c9)\n  \"I am very sorry to the people that this evil practice in the barracks culture led to a tragic and unjust death.

Are we seeing a lot of people getting vaccinated? \n\nIndeed... Hundreds of thousands of South Korean seniors aged 60 to 74 signed up to get shots on the last day of reservations.\nTheir booking rate was remarkably above 80 percent. \nSo far, over 7 million people have received their first shots of COVID-19 vaccines, accounting for 13-point-8 percent of the total population.  \nWhile the number of people who have been fully vaccinated stood at 2-point-2 million...that's 4-point-4 percent of the total population. \nOn Friday, South Korea reported 695 new cases, hovering in the six-hundreds for the third straight day. \nThat's all I have for now, back to you Jung-min.",

Bo-kyoung I heard that you visited an exhibition that showcases the future of Korean art?\n\nThat's right,... Mok-yeon,... Art lovers, especially those interested in installation art may well know internationally-acclaimed artist Lee Bul,... who is actually more famous on the global stage than here in South Korea as she's had lots of solo exhibitions at museums abroad. (\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) Well, interesting fact -- the artist first gained recognition after being introduced at the MMCA's special exhibition program. This biennial exhibition has come back with works from 15 emerging artists. Let's see what kinds of artwork stand at the forefront of contemporary art.\n\n\nLee Bul, Choi Jeonghwa and Lee Hyungkoo.\nThese well-recognized Korean artists were first introduced through the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art's \"Young Korean Artists\" program.\n\n(Standup/ed:steve)\n\"As one of a premier exhibition programs held by the MMCA,... \"Young Korean Artists\" was first held in 1981,... making this year its 40th anniversary.\"\n\nThe exhibition has been discovering and housing emerging artists based on the MMCA curators' recommendations and outside experts' research and discussion. \nThe curator says this year showcases 15 boundary-pushing artists who come up with art through an extended range of media. \n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"It is meaningful to present artists who have explored their own artistic properties in a variety of fields such as painting, sculptures, installations, media-art, pottery and photography.\"\n\nOne artist tried to show the need for ecological balance in our lives using natural materials such as weeds and clay,... while another found motives from Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" and used porcelain to show human desires and anxiety. \nThough each artist varies in how they express their perspectives on society,... there was one experience they all had in common: the pandemic.\nOne artist focused on how the pandemic has made lots of people nostalgic.\n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8)\n\"I have restored a record store from a bright city during the late 1980s and early 90s to show the times when economy was developing fast. I used hi-fi audio and old records. Such images usually serve as the background of the 'city-pop' genre too.\" \n\nAnother artist filmed an acrobat navigating an abandoned water intake plant,... showing how in unprecedented times of disaster, physical senses can be more valid than knowledge. \nThose interested in seeing Korea's young artists' adventurous attitudes can find the exhibition at the MMCA in Gwacheon until September 22nd. (PKG\ub05d)\n\n(STUDIO BACK)\n\nI am sure those who visit the exhibition will be fascinated by the cutting-edge works on display. I hear you also have some exciting news for musical lovers.\n\nTotally,... I am sure lots of people would love to visit London's West End and see big-name musicals such as Wicked and the Lion King. \n(\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) As travel is difficult these days,... on 3AM Monday, Korean time, \"The Shows Must Go On\" -- a showcase of 18 London musicals all on one stage together will be live-streamed on YouTube. \nThis show featuring the world\u2019s most iconic musicals has been on stage at the Palace Theatre from June 2nd.\n\n(ENGLISH/\uc5ec) Reuters 3207\n\"Well, this is the first time all, you know, all of these West End shows have been together on one stage, and I think after everything that's happened, we needed that solidarity. And we needed that kind of union and coming together.\"\n\nThe live broadcast follows \"The Shows Must Go On\" campaign, which raised over 900-thousand euros for theater charities.\nAnd for those who don't fancy getting up in the early hours of the morning to watch it, don't worry, the performance will be available online for free for seven days after the livestream. \n\nThat sounds like a real treat for musical lovers. Thank you Bo-kyoung for sharing with us these cultural updates. \n\nThank you.",

Because the meal kit comes with fresh ingredients, more people have chosen the products over pre-cooked meals.\" \n\nSales skyrocketed during the pandemic, reflecting the high demand from customers. \n\n(Korean-\uc5ec\uc790) \n\"We consume meal kits more often since Covid-19 with less dining out. It costs me less money than buying all the ingredients by myself.\"  \n\nWith the pandemic changing people's cooking and dining habits, the meal kit market is expected to keep growing for some time.\nSeo Eunkyung, Arirang News.",

I wanted to share what I have been given with others.\" \n\nFor the nearly 8 months of volunteering since last November, there has been an outpouring of support from across social media... donating money... a bag of rice for the meal... or some more masks. \nOnce the food is ready, the group takes the subway to Seoul Station.\n\n(KOREAN) SOV \n\"You do this every Friday night over the past 8 months. Are you tired at all?\" \n\n(KOREAN-\ub0a8) \n \"It would be a lie if I say I'm not tired at all. But, it's worth doing it, so I keep going with the work.\" \n\nThe group always cooks the meals... instead of just purchasing them. \nKim explains doing this way makes the job more meaningful. \nFor an hour and half, they go around and knock on each tent. \nNow... they are more welcome than ever before. \n\n(KOREAN-\ub0a8) SOV \n\"We've been gratefully eating this meal. We want to thank them for coming to Seoul Station and helping us.\" \n\n(STANDUP) ed: Paul \n \"The group said they will keep delivering food, even after the pandemic ends. And that sharing is not just about handing out food, but is an opportunity to be kind and bring hope to others. \nChoi Won-jong, Arirang News.\"",

Thank you for coming on today.\n\n\n\n Stocks on Wall Street were down overnight, especially tech and some of the big growth names. The Nasdaq off by more than one percent, on the Dow, the decline was not so big. Investors were looking to the U.S. jobs numbers coming out. Tell us what was behind the decline on Thursday, and take us through the global markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Korean stocks started out lower today, too, but by the end of the session the KOSPI and the KOSDAQ had recovered almost all of that. Today, retail investors were buyers and institutions turned to selling. What's the story in the domestic market?\n\n \n\n\n\n Let's look at the exchange rate for a minute. A week ago, the won was as strong against the dollar as it's been in a few months. Now it's come back up a bit to around 11-16. What's caused the dollar to gain strength again, and what's your outlook in terms of currencies?\n\n \n\n\n\n Now, looking at cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is back up from last month's low, but it's nowhere near it's high from earlier this spring. And the Biden administration looking to strengthen its response against cybercrime, much of which is done, of course, to get Bitcoin, like these ransomware attacks. What do you see happening in the crypto space?",

In this sense,... we need policy support to boost employment in the second half of the year, and measures to strengthen social inclusion.\"\n\n Hong also said the government will use tax revenues to finance the extra budget,... and that there would be no need to issue more bonds.\nSouth Korea collected more tax revenues than expected in the first quarter of this year.\nThe country collected 88-point-5 trillion Korean won, or some 80 billion U.S. dollars from January to March --up around 17 billion dollars compared to a year earlier.\nMore tax is expected to be collected throughout this year as the economy recovers from the pandemic.\nBut one expert warns of potential risks that could rise from hasty use of tax revenues.\n\n(KOREAN \ub0a8) \uc804\ud654\uc778\ud130\ubdf0, \uc0ac\uc9c4 \uc788\uc74c\n \"From an economic perspective, refraining from issuing more deficit-covering bonds is a right move. But South Korea generally has more tax revenue in the first half than the second half. Using too much of the tax revenue in the first half raises risks of financial pressure in the second half of the year.\"\n\n South Korea has drawn up five rounds of disaster relief funds since the start of the pandemic last year.\nIf it passes, this would be the second extra budget for the year, and the sixth overall.\nKim Jae-hee, Arirang News.",

What's your assessment of the results of the summit? \n\n Solutions for Our Climate is working closely with experts in and out of Korea in various areas including climate finance and renewable energy, with the aim of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. \nIn your observation, what is the single most urgent priority in reaching the goal?\n\n To fight climate change, global leaders are considering 'carbon tax' to reduce burning of carbon-based fuels like coal, oil and gasoline. According to the World Bank, nearly 90 countries are mulling to impose carbon tax to meet their Paris Agreement goals. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n South Korea is set to unveil its upgraded 2030 emissions target at the COP26 climate conference in November. Korea had previously vowed to reduce emissions by 24.4% from its level in 2017. What would be a realistic goal for South Korea, and what are some pragmatic and feasible ways to hit the new target?\n\n This year marks the first year of action under the Paris Agreement. How do you assess major economies' NDC goals, and their green efforts thus far?\n\n President Moon, in his P4G summit opening speech, vowed 9 million-dollar support to create Green New Deal Trust Fund and to expand official development assistance in green projects. \nHow do you see this, and what kind of government measures are needed to ensure an effective use of the support funds?\n\n Jessica Yun of Solutions for Our Climate for our news in-depth tonight.

        "artcl_ctt": "After the leaders of South Korea and the United States wrapped up bilateral talks last month, U.S. President Joe Biden appointed a special envoy for North Korea, Ambassador Sung Kim. With the months-long policy review on North Korea complete and South Korea's backing on Washington's \"practical approach\", Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told reporters last Wednesday that the U.S. is ready for dialogue.\nThe ball is in now in North Korea's court. How will it respond?\nWe speak with Mark P. Barry, Associate Editor of the International Journal on World Peace, and Ramon Pacheco Pardo, Korea Chair at the Brussels School of Governance and Associate Professor of International Relations at King's College London.\n\n1. Dr. Barry:  U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman says the U.S. has already signaled it is \u201cready and prepared to have dialogue with the DPRK,\u201d adding that Washington hopes North Korea will take them up on that possibility. Is this an open invitation to talk? \n\n2. Dr. Pacheco Pardo: North Korea initially criticised Washington\u2019s policy approach saying it is still hostile towards the regime. What do you think were its main concerns, or the source of its disappointment?\n\n3. Dr. Barry: The U.S. is taking a calibrated approach, and the administration has made clear it wants to avoid policy failures of the past. But there\u2019s been some criticism that this hasn\u2019t offered much clarity on how Washington will handle the biggest sticking points. What do you think should be Mr. Biden\u2019s way forward?\n\n4. Dr. Pacheco Pardo: Do you think North Korea is considering talking with Sung Kim? If they decide to give things a shot, who would be his counterpart, and how would the talks proceed?\n\n5. Dr. Barry: As Pyeongyang dissects America\u2019s policy review, what are some factors Kim Jong-un would be considering, particularly with the geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the North\u2019s only ally China?\n\n6. (\uc0dd\ub7b5\uac00\ub2a5) Dr. Pacheco Pardo: President Moon Jae-in has been working hard to keep the North Korea agenda alive. Do you see Seoul continuing to fulfill that role to facilitate progress in U.S.-N. Korea dialogue and trust-building?\n \n7. Dr. Pacheco Pardo: Also,  North Korea's ruling party has established a de facto second-in-command under leader Kim Jong Un. Are we seeing the North Korean leadership shift from a dictatorship to a more party-based political system? What do you think was the reason for this major change?\n\nMark P. Barry, Associate Editor of the International Journal on World Peace, and Ramon Pacheco Pardo, Korea Chair at the Brussels School of Governance and Associate Professor of International Relations at King's College London. Thank you for your time today.\n(New York) - \ub179\ud654\n\n(London)",

We\u2019ve been able to ride the K-Culture phenomenon by marketing health supplements, fermented products and instant foods, which has led to the success we see today.\n\nTaste tests of Korean food is becoming popular online\n\nRiding the global popularity of Korean food products,... the country\u2019s agricultural exports hit a new high in 2020,... to the tune of 7-and-a-half billion US dollars.\n\nKorea-made frozen dumplings popular in the U.S.\n\nKorean-made frozen dumpling products,... have also won over American customers.\n\nMarketed under the Korean name \u2018Mandoo\u2019 for dumplings,... they have found a niche among health-conscious consumers in the US.\n\nKorean-style dumpling wrappers are very thin, and they have rich fillings that consist of a balanced mix of vegetables and meats, capturing the hearts of many American consumers. Dumplings have often been enjoyed as light snacks, not only in Korea, but also in countries abroad, but more consumers are now looking at them as full meal option. This has led to the growing consumption of dumplings, and a more prominent fixture on many dinner tables.\n\n60% of CJ\u2019s dumpling revenues are generated by exports\n\nThis local food company raked in nearly 900 million dollars... from dumpling sales alone... with exports accounting for more than half of those revenues.\n\nThe popularity of Korean food... has extended to its more traditional staples as well.\n\nKimchi exports surpass US$ 140 mil. in 2020\n\nFermented foods,... especially Kimchi,... have been at the heart of this trend,... helping Kimchi exports reach an all-time in 2020.\n\nSo what can Korean foodmakers do... to build upon this latest success,... and ensure that it can last for years to come?\n\nIM Moo-hyeog, Professor / Dept. of Food Engineering, Daegu University\n\nFood companies must work with the government to create international standards on non-tariff barriers and regulations on the use of pesticides for example. Also, there are some food ingredients that are consumed almost exclusively in Korea, like the type of cabbage used in the making of Kimchi, which is called Chinese cabbage in many countries abroad. The government has had them re-labeled as Kimchi cabbages, and officially catalogued in food listings worldwide.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic... has been an unexpected boon for Korean foodmakers,... and now they will need to put a long-term strategy in place... to carry them forward as consumer palates and preferences... continue to change.",

Thank you for coming in.  \n\n\n\n\n The WHO and the Korean government has recommended 'aceta-mino-phen' medicines in case of post-vaccine fever. \nHealth authorities say, over 70 different painkiller brands contain the 'aceta-mino-phen' ingredient but why do you think Tylenol is being preferred over others? Does it induce a special effect?\n\n The Korean Pharmaceutical Association, and the Korean Medical Association has called on smooth production and supply of 'acetaminophen' medicines, as Tylenol continues to be sold out at many drugstores in the country. What measures are needed to ensure smooth supply of 'acetaminophen' painkillers?\n\n The Tylenol craze phenomenon has also shed light on the safe usage of painkillers. \nCould you walk us through the things we have to know before we take the pill, for instance, maximum Tylenol intake per day and from what body temperature should we take the pill?\n\n The WHO has once recommended AGAINST the use of 'ibuprofen' - based painkillers AFTER getting vaccinated... citing possible interference in forming antibodies. \nWhat are your thoughts on taking 'ibuprofen' medicine to reduce post-vaccination fever?\n\n What are some other common after-effects of COVID-19 vaccination, and what medicine do you recommend for the different symptoms?\n\nThat wraps up our discussion for today, many thanks for your insights.",

Are you concerned?\n\n Howard Catton, CEO of the ICN live from Geneva for us. Thank you for sharing your perspectives with us.",

South Korea on Saturday picked up a comfortable 5-0 win over Turkmenistan.\nIn the first of three World Cup qualifiers this month, Korea ran out winners thanks to a brace from Hwang Ui-jo, and goals from Nam Tae-hee, Kim Young-gwon and K League returnee Kwon Chang-hoon.\nIt was a slick and impressive performance with manager Paulo Bento finally able to have most of his key players fit and available for selection.\nEarlier on Saturday, Lebanon beat Sri Lanka 3-2 meaning that Korea\u2019s lead at the top of the group is on goal difference only\u2026 plus 15 to plus 5.\nKorea face Sri Lanka this Wednesday followed by Lebanon on Sunday.\nMeanwhile, former Barcelona youth Paik Seung-ho on Sunday scored his first K League goal.\nAllowed to leave the Olympic team\u2019s training camp, Paik gave Jeonbuk a 16th minute lead via a free-kick from outside the area in a 5-1 win over Seongnam.\nIt was Jeonbuk\u2019s first win in eight matches in all competitions.\n\nSouth Korea's captain is Son Heung-min and he was named in the Premier League Team of the Year, what can you tell us about that?\n\nYes, indeed. After a superb season for Son, he has been named in the Premier League Team of the Year.\nThe eleven is voted for annually by fellow players and recognizes the top flight\u2019s outstanding performers.\nSon ended the season on 17 goals, the fourth highest in the league this year and on a personal best.\nHe also laid on 10 assists and combined with Harry Kane for a record 14 goals this term.\n\nA change up to baseball now, I understand the KBO has asked the South Korean government to ease COVID-19 restrictions in stadiums. Give us more details. \n\nKBO has asked the South Korean government to ease COVID-19 protocols on fans in the stands. \nCurrently, fans aren't allowed to consume food or drink from their seats\u2026 they can only do so in designated areas in the concourse.\nKBO also wants to see crowd capacity caps raised. \nCurrently, the cap is at 10 percent in the greater Seoul area and 30 percent elsewhere, based on social distancing levels. \nOnly recently did health authorities allow fans to sit together in a row if they're traveling as a group of four.\nThe sports ministry on Sunday confirmed the request and said that the matter will be discussed.\nIt has been reported that each club lost on average 100 million U.S. dollars last year due to a lack of income from fans.\n\nAnd finally to tennis... Roger Federer said on Saturday that he was going to decide whether or not to withdraw from the French Open the following day. \nIt seems like injury concerns have influence in his decision?\n\nRoger Federer has withdrawn from the French Open to protect his body despite reaching the fourth round.\nThe 20-time Grand Slam champion made the decision the day after a grueling third-round win over Dominik Koepfer.\nHe said that he feels it is important to listen to his body after over a year of rehab.\nAdding that he was thrilled to be able to return to playing after knee surgery.\nFederer has withdrawn to concentrate on Wimbledon and was due to face Italian ninth seed Matteo Berrettini on Monday.\nElsewhere, Serena Williams was knocked out in the fourth round.\nWilliams lost in straight sets 6-3, 7-5 to Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan.\n\n Thank-you for that, Paul. We shall see you next week.\n\n Thank-you.",

        "artcl_ctt": "The electric vehicle industry is growing fast.\nAround the world, EVs can be seen on the streets in increasing numbers.\nLast year, despite the pandemic, sales grew 40 percent.\nThere's been corresponding growth, of course, for EV battery producers, who are making big investments in their factories and supply chains to keep up.\nThese battery makers include the South Korean companies LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation as well as the world's biggest battery producer, the Chinese company CATL.\nIt's a sector that's been making the headlines recently.\nSo with an in-depth look at the EV battery market and its dynamics, I'm joined in the studio by our very own Kim Sung-min, who's done a deep dive into the sector.\nSungmin, good to have you back in the studio.\n\n Good to be with you.\n\n Sungmin, let's start with the big picture. EVs are actually taking off now, commercially, and so it seems this could only mean that there would be a global race to take the lead in EV batteries. Tell us about the state of the industry right now.\n\nDevin, just last year,... some 2-point-5 million battery-electric and plug-in-hybrid cars were sold globally.\nThis year, that number is expected to grow by 70 percent.\nAnd that means the market for the vehicle's most crucial part, the battery, will also see tremendous growth.\nBy 2025, the global EV battery market is expected to grow by 25 percent... to reach more than 67 billion U.S. dollars.\nAnd demand for EV batteries is forecast to rise 23 fold in the next ten years.\n\n So this explains all the announcements from the world's big battery makers about new investment plans. At the time of President Moon's summit with President Biden, the South Korean companies LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation... announced another 14 billion dollars' worth of investments in new plants in America.\nIt's interesting that unlike the combustion engines of the past, it's not carmakers that are making this key component, but other companies instead.\n\nYes, in addition to these big investments to expand production capacity, a key feature of the market is the partnerships between automakers and battery producers. \nIt's a major trend as you can see on this list. \nYou can see South Korea's biggest battery makers, SK Innovation and LG Energy Solution partnering up with the top two automakers of the U.S., Ford and GM.\n\n(KOREA - \ub0a8) \n\"Conventional carmakers have produced their own engines and parts for over a hundred years. But because the shift to electric cars started happening so quickly,... they weren't ready. So they had no choice but to partner with battery makers.\"\n\nThis is actually a win-win situation for both sides... because the automakers get a stable supply... while the battery makers can grow their business based on stable demand.\n\n The market is quite new, and companies are in a race, jockeying for position. For now, who's leading the market?\n\n Undoubtedly, the frontrunner is China's CATL,... which takes up 32-point-5 percent of the global market share.\n In second place is the South Korean firm LG Energy Solution.\nBut right now, even if you add up the market shares of the top three Korean battery producers, theirs is smaller than CATL's. \nExperts say this could change, though, because the market is still young. \n\n(KOREA - \ub0a8) \n\"The U.S. is aiming to become a powerhouse in the global EV market. There are no international standards for EV batteries yet. But once standards are made,... then Korea could be in a favorable position thanks to its partnership with the U.S.\" \n\n Alright, Sung-min. Well, when we think if EVs, we think \"eco-friendly.\" But there are some potential problems here. Like what happens to an EV battery that's gone flat after a few years? It seems this would have a negative environment impact.\n\nRight. That's why EV battery recycling is so important.\nEV batteries usually last about ten years.\nOnce a battery's efficiency falls below 80 percent, then it's considered to be flat, and should be disposed of.\nSouth Korea is expected to produce around 400-thousand flat batteries by 2030, and that number will grow exponentially as millions of EVs are sold in the coming decades.\nUnlike smart phone batteries, EV batteries are huge, each of them weighing around 400 killograms.\nThey're highly flammable,... so proper disposal is important.\nBut also, recycling the battery materials offsets the environmental damage that would be caused if you just went out and mined more resources.\n\n(KOREAN - \ub0a8)\n \"The world is trying to reduce carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality. The amount of emissions from recycling nickel is 60 to 70 percent less than from sourcing nickel from mines. This alone can be the reason to recycle.\"\n\n So, we can protect the environment in this very direct way by recycling EV batteries. But I imagine it would also save money for the battery makers and help them use their resources more efficiently. \n\n Yes, it all comes down to maximizing efficiency... because resources are finite.\n The materials used in battery-making -- like copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium and manganese -- exist in limited amounts, and can be found in only a few countries.\nRecycling... extracts these resources to be used in making new batteries.\nSo this can maximize efficiency while helping countries reduce their reliance on others in securing the resources.\n\n So battery recycling is an important task both environmentally and economically.\nAnd if electric vehicles are going to be with us now for generations, then there'll be an industry to process all these flat batteries.\n\nRight.\nThe global battery recycling market is expected to grow by 18 billion U.S. dollars by 2030.\nThe Biden administration is reportedly looking into boosting the recycling of batteries in the U.S.... so that lithium and other metals can be reused to strengthen the American EV industry.\nGlobal automakers like Tesla and Volkswagen are opening up their own battery-recycling plants so they can get materials and reuse them.\nSouth Korea is getting in on it, too.\nOne of the biggest recycling plants in the country... is operated by a company called SungEel HiTech.\nIts plant is big enough that the company calls it a \"mine\" located in the city.\n\n(KOREAN - \ub0a8) 22\ubd84\n\"Normally, one nickel mine produces around 10-thousand to 40-thousand tons of nickel a year. Here, just by recycling,... we can produce 4-thousand-400 tons of cobalt and nickel.\"\n\nThe company produces around 2-hundred-20 tons of Nickel and 1-hundred-40 tons of Cobalt per month,... which is a significant contributing to the supply of these materials.\n\n So they've already figured out how to do this and have made a viable business out of it.\nSungmin, you actually went to their plant down in Jeollabuk-do Province and saw exactly how they did it.\nSo how do they recycle these massive batteries that are so high tech and even dangerous?\n\n Normally, discarded electronics are shredded in bulk to be sorted and reprocessed. \nBut EV batteries are lithium-ion, like the batteries in our phones.\nThat means they're flammable... and have to be handled carefully.\nSo first, the batteries are dismantled by hand.\nThen, they're shredded separately in machines filled with liquids or gases that keep them from catching fire.\nThe result of this step... is kind of a mix of chemicals and materials they call \"black mass.\"\nNext, they extract the valuable components -- the metals I mentioned, like nickel and cobalt -- which are sent to companies that will use them to produce new batteries. \n\n That's fascinating. Again, a few companies are taking the initiative here on what is going to be a big business, especially when countries start making it mandatory.\nSome are already taking steps in that direction. Tell us about that.\n\nGovernments are inching toward requiring some level of recycling for EV batteries.\nThe EU has a specific roadmap for the management of flat batteries.\nThe roadmap sets out specific requirements... for battery producers and third parties acting on their behalf... who have to take back waste batteries from end-users.\nAll these batteries must be recycled,... and the recycling process has to reach specific minimum levels of efficiency.\nSouth Korea has not yet made specific rules, but there will have to be discussions about rules sooner rather than later so that the industry can achieve sustainability in the long term.\n\nThank you, Sung-min.",

The purpose is to close the loopholes multinational firms exploited to reduce their taxes, ensuring they pay more in the nations where they operate. We look at what this means for multinational corporations, and whether this can sufficiently address profit shifting and create a level playing field.\nFor this, we turn to Anup Srivastava, Canada Research Chair of the Haskayne School of Business at the University of Calgary. We also connect with An Sung-bae, Director of International Macroeconomics at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.\n\n\n1. Anup: G7 financial ministers agreed on a minimum 15 percent tax rate targeting huge multinational companies - their plan is built on two pillars. How would this work?\n\n\n2. Sungbae: The deal agreed by G7 financial ministers to impose a minimum 15 percent tax rate for huge multinational companies is being seen as historic reform. But how meaningful is this breakthrough, and is it enough to create a level playing field? \n\n\n3. Anup: The Biden administration has been particularly eager to reach an agreement because a global minimum tax is closely tied to its plans to raise the corporate tax rate in the United States to 28 percent from 21 percent to help pay for the president\u2019s infrastructure proposal. Would this work, and is it sustainable?\n\n\n4. Sungbae: How will this tax plan affect South Korea where corporate tax currently ranges from 17 to 27.5 percent?\n\n\n5. Sungbae: Would the global tax impact South Korean firms like Samsung and LG? Could it hurt their bottom line and make them less competitive? \n\n6. Anup: Ireland has been against the global minimum tax, saying it would hurt its economic model, given its tax rate of 12.5 percent. What impact will this have on tax haven countries?\n\n7. Sungbae: How do you think the global tax plan will be received by the G20 countries next month? What hurdles are you expecting?\n\n8. Anup: Some say a minimum 15% tax rate isn\u2019t enough to create a level playing field. What\u2019s your view? Will G20 countries get on board with this?\n\nAnup Srivastava at the University of Calgary and An Sung-bae at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.

How are you doing?\n\n1.\nAs the host of the G7 Summit taking place this year, Britain has pledged to use its G7 presidency to help the whole world \"fight and build back better\" from the COVID-19 pandemic. How does your country envision this recovery?\n\n2.\nWhat kind of role or input is the UK is hoping to see from the Plus 3 countries, particularly South Korea? What do you think South Korea can contribute at the meeting?\n\n3.\nBritain has said it will \"champion shared values\" through this summit, amid geopolitical tensions and concerns over cybersecurity, high tech supply chains and human rights. What are the core values that need to be protected, and what outcomes is Britain hoping to see?\n\n4.\nIt seems cooperation in both trade and security will be made more exclusively between trusted partners. What are key areas you see South Korea and Britain cooperating on? Are there any particular technologies or industries?\n\n5.\nSouth Korea last week held the Partnership for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G), and the event was seen as a stepping stone for the upcoming COP26 Summit in Glasgow. What do you make of South Korea's climate commitments, and do you think it has the potential to host the UN Climate Conference in 2023?\n\n6.\nHow has the British Embassy in Seoul been working with S. Korean firms and organisations to push for green growth and net zero goals?\n\n7.\nYou've been working with K-Pop girlband BLACKPINK. How was that collaboration? How do you see the potential of K-Pop and K-Culture in advancing South Korea's soft power and advocating shared global values?\n\n8.\nAs ambassador, you've been actively immersing yourself in the local culture, and engaging with diverse social groups, helping build a more equitable and inclusive society. What are the aspects that you think should be celebrated and some positive changes you hope to see?\n\n\nThat was Simon Smith, British Ambassador to South Korea. \nThank you for your time.\n(Seoul)",

Central regions will have a cloudy day with a chance of passing rain during the day. The south will be hot and sunny with very strong UV rays. \n\n Highs will be 2 to 4 degrees higher than yesterday, Seoul will see a high of 28 degrees that's 4 degrees higher, while Daegu and Gwangju will have scorchers, topping out at 33 under sunny skies. \n\nIn fact, a heat wave impact forecast was issued in southern inland regions yesterday for the first time this season, coming 7 days later than last year. It's at attention level so people spending a lot of time outdoors will need to drink plenty of water and take good care of yourself.  \n\n Summer heat is in store for the capital region tomorrow with strong sunshine then rain is in the forecast from late Thursday into Friday. \n\nThat's Korea for you and here's a look at weather conditions around the world.",

I think it would be meaningful to have my brother there.\"\n\n Bezos is due to step down as Amazon's chief on July 5, just 15 days before the space flight, making this his retirement trip. Joining him will be the winner of a month-long auction for a seat on the flight. The bidding was at 2.8 million dollars Monday morning, but hit 3.2 million dollars after Blue Origin's announcement.\n How much regular tickets will go for, the company has yet to decide.\nLee Eun-jin, Arirang News.",

Thanks for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n The countries of the G7 have agreed to support a minimum rate for corporate taxes around the world to stop companies from headquartering in ultra-low-tax countries to avoid taxes. The rate would be at least 15 percent. Korea has a rate higher than that. How do you see this proposal affecting Korea and/or Korean companies?\n\n \n\n\n\n Turning to the markets, stocks overnight on Wall Street were lower on the Dow and the S&P, but a gain of about half a percent on the Nasdaq. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n \n\n\n\n Korean stocks were a mix today, and almost flat. Coming off of an all-time high yesterday on the KOSPI. Looks like maybe some profit-taking by individual investors. Tell us about the domestic market.\n\n \n\n\n\n Korea's current account, which is a broad measure of trade, posted a surplus in April. That's 12 months in a row now we've had a surplus. Interestingly, it's the first April surplus in three years. What's happening there with the current account?",

Seoul will begin at 20 degrees Celsius.\n\n Aside from Jeju Island, the daytime will be sunny overall. Chuncheon will make it to 31 degrees. Daejeon and Daegu at 32 degrees.\n\n Meanwhile, we're only about two weeks away from the summer solstice, which is the day with the most hours of daylight. The nights will start getting longer after that point, so enjoy the long sunshine while you can.\n\nThat's all for now, and here are the weather conditions around the world.",
