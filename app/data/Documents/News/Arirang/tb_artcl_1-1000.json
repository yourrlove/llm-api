Marie Curie was born in 1867 in Warsaw and moved to Paris in 1891.\nIn 1903, Marie, her husband and a French scientist won a Nobel Prize in Physics for their studies on radioactivity.\nIn 1911, Marie Curie added another Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for discovering radium and polonium,... naming the latter after Poland.",

They came here at weekends, Easter holidays, Summer holidays.\"\n\nThe 120 square meter house is priced at more than 950-thousand U.S. dollars and is badly in disrepair.\nBut a local real estate agency said that its peeling wallpaper, original fireplaces and floor tiles are reminiscent of the Curie's time. \nOne of the first women to study science at the Sorbonne,... Marie Curie was born in 1867 in Warsaw and moved to Paris in 1891.\nIn 1903, Marie, her husband and a French scientist won a Nobel Prize in Physics for their studies on radioactivity.\nIn 1911, Marie Curie added another Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for discovering radium and polonium,... naming the latter after Poland.",

If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.\"\n\n The new guidance comes after a sharp reduction in cases in the U.S.,... the expansion of vaccines to younger people,... and vaccine efficacy against variants.\nHowever,.. the CDC still recommends vaccinated people wear masks on planes and on trains,... and at airports, mass transit hubs as well as at hospitals and doctor's offices.\n White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci backed the CDC's decision,... saying fully vaccinated people don't need to wear masks in public,... unless they're in a crowd.\nSpeaking to CBS News,... Fauci said the U.S. needs to make the transition to pre-pandemic life.\n Meanwhile, President Joe Biden celebrated the new guidelines touting his administration's vaccination program for dramatically reducing the impact of COVID-19.\n\n(English Reuters Edit No: 4216)\n \"Just a few hours ago, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, announced that they are no longer recommending that fully vaccinated people need wear masks. This recommendation holds true whether you are inside or outside. I think it's a great milestone, a great day. It's been made possible by the extraordinary success we've had in vaccinating so many Americans so quickly.\"\n\nBiden still warned that the country was not in the clear yet,... urging more Americans to go get vaccinated.\nHe stressed again, that the CDC's new guidelines only apply to those who are fully vaccinated.\nThe updated guidelines come more than a year after Americans were told to start wearing masks.\n New cases in the U.S. continue to decline,... averaging 36-thousand-700 new cases a day over the past week,... the lowest daily average since September 2020.\nLee Seung-jae, Arirang News.",

We entered the seven hundreds once again yesterday. Has it gone up today from Thursday's tally?\n\nIt has.\nWith cluster infections still popping up nationwide, South Korea reported 747 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday.\nIt's the second day in a row the daily figure's been in the seven hundreds, pushing the total number of cases above the 130-thousand mark.\n729 of Friday's caseload were transmitted locally, with Seoul and the surrounding area accounting for around 430.\nTwo more have died, raising the death toll to one-thousand-893.\nThat's all I have for now Mok-yeon.\nBack to you.",

        "artcl_ctt": "It's Friday,\u2026 and it means it's time for our regular weekly 'Life With Culture' segment. As always, our culture correspondent Kim Bo-kyoung is here in the studio, Bo-kyoung, I heard you have visited a regional museum that recently received some valuable artwork?\n\nThat's right Conn-young. As you know, most of the art collection donated by the late Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee went to the National Museum of Korea and MMCA,\u2026 (\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) yet some pieces have gone to regional museums that were established to honor artists such as Park Soo-keun and Lee Jungseop.\nThose regional museums are getting ready to showcase newly-donated works to the public,\u2026 and the Park Soo-keun Museum was the first to do that. Let's take a peek at what art they have introduced and the schedules of when other museums are preparing their exhibitions. \n\n\nNestled in the countryside in the small county of Yanggu, Gangwon-do Province and surrounded by birch trees is the Park Soo-keun Museum.\nIt was established in 2002 to honor the modern Korean artist in his hometown. \nWhen Hong Ra-hee - the widow of the late Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee... visited the museum not long after its establishment, she made the suggestion of creating a birch tree forest and donated trees to help. \nTies between the museum and the Lee family have lasted until this day,\u2026 enabling them to make donations of Park Soo-keun's artwork.\n\n(Standup/ed:steve)\n\"The museum received a total of 18 of the artist's paintings - four oil paintings and 14 drawings. Park's paintings are simple and modest, yet they portray the everyday lives of regular people in a heartwarming way.\"\n\nPark is known for displaying empathy toward people's sorrows during the Korean War through his work,\u2026 and also for his unique technique of imparting physical textures onto the painting itself.\nOne of the four donated oil paintings is \"A Girl Who Carries the Baby.\"\n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"The one showing a girl looking ahead is a very rare piece. Though things would have been difficult for her during that period, she has a warm smile on her face. This is typical of how Park liked to portray people.\"\n\nExperts say donating priceless art is good for the local economy and the reputation of the museums.\n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"When you take a look at other museums abroad,... they have a donation culture and exhibition halls honoring the donors. We are planning to make one too in a few years. I hope we see more of this in Korea.\"\n\nBut this is not the only regional museum to receive artwork donations of hometown artist's. \nDaegu Art Museum will show to the public in June 21 donated pieces, including works by modern artist Lee Insung. \nThe Lee Jungseop Art Museum on Jeju Island received 12 pieces,... and is planning an exhibition for September. \nThat's also when the Jeonnam Museum of Art is preparing to showcase 21 pieces of work by artists such as Chun Kyung-ja and Kim Whanki. (PKG \ub05d)\n\n(STUDIO\ub85c BACK)\n\nLocal people must be very excited to see the exhibition. Bo-kyoung, regarding the rest of the donated art collection,... though most works have gone to the National Museum of Korea and MMCA for now,... the final destination remains unknown. I heard regional politicians are competing to bring the art collection to their regions,... what is this all about?\n\nFirst of all, we need to talk about how large and valuable the late Lee Kun-hee's donated art collection is. Many art museums might only have two to three hundred pieces of art. (\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) But this time as you know, Lee's art collection numbers over 20-thousand pieces which is more than any museum can handle. Adding on to that,.. experts say the value of the art collection is very high.\n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8) \ud669\ud76c Apr. 28\n\"It is practically the first time in Korea such a large art collection including designated cultural assets and artwork with high artistic value has been donated. Such a donation is unprecedented even overseas. The donated cultural assets and artwork span from fine arts and archeology to modern and contemporary art.\"\n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8) \uc804\ud654\uc778\ud130\ubdf0\n\"Not only the pieces that are well-known, but also those that need to be verified and re-evaluated are included in the donation. People will be able to see the excellence of traditional Korean art through this collection.  \n\nDue to its size and value,... a few days after the press briefing,... President Moon Jae-in ordered those involved to come up with ways to manage the collection, which led to speculation that there might be a museum built that's dedicated to Lee's collection alone. \nThis is leading regional politicians to push for such a museum to be built in their own city or region.\nThe competition is going on across the country, with cities like Busan, Yeosu and Daegu all claiming special ties to Samsung. \n\n I wonder how that vast collection is going to be managed. Thank you Bo-kyoung for sharing with us the points of the issue. I will see you next week.\n\nThank you.",

Thanks for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Let's start with the inflation question, Mr. Yoo. In February and March, we saw Treasury yields start to rise, and then last month data show a big rise in U.S. consumer prices. In terms of asset prices, it would seem some of this is flowing into the cryptocurrency market. What could you say about crypto, and whether this is a concern?\n\n \n\n\n\n Stocks on Wall Street bounced back a bit on Thursday from the big declines they've had recently, led by tech stocks. There are plenty of people out there warning that there could be a further correction. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n \n\n \n\n Much the same today here in Korea today, stocks back up by a significant amount. With retail investors buying, foreigners and institutions selling. Tell us about the local market.\n\n \n\n\n\n Data from the Bank of Korea show the prices of Korea's exports were up last month, including for semiconductors, which have also seen a big rise in export volume. And for the first time in five months, the price of imports was down. So what's happening when it comes to trade?",

Even though the U.S. government mentioned that their review is complete, their detailed policy has not been revealed yet. I think her visit to the DMZ and Seoul this time would provide another level of information for the U.S. to use to provide a new approach to North Korea.\"\n\n Earlier on Friday, Haines reportedly had a luncheon meeting with her South Korean counterpart Park Jie-won -- to discuss bilateral cooperation in exchanging North Korea-related intelligence.\nThis comes just two days after their talks in Tokyo on Wednesday,... which also involved Japan.\nOn Thursday,... Haines visited the Demilitarized Zone... and met with officials at Seoul's Defense Intelligence Agency.\n She is also known to have met with Seoul's National Security Advisor Suh Hoon -- who has experience in negotiating with North Korea.\nHaines wrapped up her three-day stay in South Korea on Friday.\nKim Min-ji, Arirang News.",

Fewer people have been returning to the workforce even though businesses are now ready to reopen.\nToday we discuss what's going on in the world's largest economy and what the worrying numbers may mean for South Korea.\nFor this we connect with Dr. Kim Jinill, Professor of Economics, Korea University.\nWe also have Dr. Micah Pollak, Professor of Economics, Indiana University Northwest.\n\n1.\n Dr. Kim: Markets had already expected a rise in inflation before the consumer price index was released last week - but what's the reason behind such steep inflation, and why is this a concern?\n\n2.\n Dr. Kim:  The Fed says the price surges would be temporary before balancing out. But some prominent economists like Larry Summers have long warned that Mr. Biden's 1.9 billion dollar stimulus could overheat the U.S. economy,... increasing inflation risk. What is your opinion? Do you think the recent inflation trend is just a phase as the economy reopens or will it be more enduring?\n\n3.\nDr. Pollak: What are your thoughts on this, amid concerns that further inflation could outpace gains in wages and leave consumers struggling to make ends meet. Do you share that concern?\n\n4.\nDr. Pollak: The Labor Department reported last week that U.S. employers added 266,000 jobs in April, far less than estimates by economists of 1 million new jobs, with the unemployment rate little changed at 6.1 percent. Some say COVID-19 stimulus measures are incentivising people to pass up job opportunities. Would you agree? \n\n5. \nDr. Pollak: Companies facing labor shortages are offering bonuses and even higher starting salaries to attract new workers. Do you see this trend continuing? \n\n6.\nDr. Kim: What would the Fed do if its prediction turns out to be wrong and inflation stays too high? And what would a rise in interest rates mean for South Korea?\n\n7.\n Dr. Kim: In South Korea, consumer prices also shot up 2.3 percent in April, the largest increase in almost four years, and higher prices of raw materials are also fueling concerns about inflationary pressure. What are your thoughts?\n\n8.\nDr. Pollak: What adjustments or developments do you hope to see in the labour market this year for a strong recovery from COVID-19?\n\nThat was Dr. Kim Jinill, Professor of Economics, Korea University and Dr. Micah Pollak, Professor of Economics, Indiana University Northwest.\nThank you for your insights todday.\n(Indiana) - \ub179\ud654\n\n(Seoul)",

Then Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said she also didn't know where she was kept.\"\n\nWhile she looked in good health during the 30-minute meeting with her legal team,... her top lawyer said she had no access to newspapers,... and was only partially aware of what was happening outside.\n Her legal team also noted that Aung San Suu Kyi expressed support for the National League for Democracy party,... saying it will be there as long as the people are,... because the party was founded for the people.\nHer remarks come as the junta-appointed Union Election Commission called for the NLD party to be abolished, citing alleged voter fraud in last November's election.\nIt has also threatened action against who they called the \"traitors\" involved.\n The ousted leader has been under house arrest since she was taken into custody in the hours following the coup.\nThe new military regime has filed six charges against her.\nHer next hearing is set for June 7th.\nLee Seung-jae, Arirang News.",

The capital region and western areas will see rain into the afternoon. Other regions will have more rain through this evening. \n\n Morning temperatures are in the low to mid teens at 14 degrees in Seoul and Busan, while Gyeongju and Chuncheon are 13.  \n\n Highs won't rise much in the afternoon, Seoul, Daegu, Gwangju and Busan will only make it to 19 degrees with passing showers. That's a few notches lower than the seasonal norms.... but we'll have normal to good air quality nationwide. \n\nThen warm temperatures will return tomorrow, highs jumping to the mid twenties under mostly to partly sunny skies. \n\nThat's Korea for you and here's a look at weather conditions around the world.",

As it has been newly introduced, the public's interest is higher than ever.   \n\nLEE Jung / Pharmacist\n\nI am receiving many requests over the phone. \nAs of now, we have about 20 kits for sale, we expecting 100 more soon. \n\nHere is how you can use COVID home test kits. \nFirst, roll the swab firmly around the inside of the nostril. Then place the fabric tip of the swab in the extraction tube and drop some diagnostic fluid onto the test strip. After 15 minutes, the red lines will appear to verify the result of the test.\n\nBenefits of At-home COVID-19 Test Kits\n\n1. Reduces possible pain caused \n2. Delivers results in real time \n\nThe new at-home coronavirus tests are different from the original Nasopharyngeal swab PCR tests because it is less painful and faster.\n\nCHOI Jae-wook, Professor / Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University \n\nThe Antigen test aims to detect the presence of a specific viral antigen and uses a different method from PCR tests which are adopted by the quarantine authorities. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests use techniques that amplify and detect DNA and RNA sequences. Therefore, the accuracy of the tests may be different from that of PCR tests.\n\n\nDrawbacks of At-home COVID-19 Test Kits\nLower sensitivity than PCR tests\n\nSensitivity : Measure of how well a test can identify ture positives  \n\nBut given the fact that the sensitivity of PCR tests is 98%, COVID-19 self-test kits have limitations of having a lower sensitivity level.\n\nSensitivity 92.9% -> The test can miss 8 infection cases out of 100 \n\nSensitivity 82.5% -> The test can miss 18 infection cases out of 100 \n\nThe new coronavirus self-test kits which are now on sale have an even lower sensitivity level. As the test kits can miss out on some infection cases, the health authorities emphasized that they are regarded as a supplementary tool.  \n\nJUNG Eun-kyeong, Commissioner / The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency \n(Aoril 29th, 2021)\n\nWe regard Self-test kits as supplementary tools \nPlease abide by the quarantine guidelines and if you are suspicious about the symptoms please do take PCR tests separately. \n  \n PCR tests are offered for free for everyone who visits any health clinic in Korea. Then what has led the government to approve the use of COVID-19 self-test kits?\n\nCHOI Jae-wook, Professor / Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University \n\nThere are no legitimate ways for quarantine authorities to enforce PCR tests on asymptomatic patients. The only effective way to detect them is by approving the use of self-test kits. However, I believe encouraging office workers, voluntary groups, and social organizations to take an active role in processing such investigations is an optimal way to detect asymptomatic patients. \n\nBenefits of At-home COVID-19 Test Kits\n\n3. preemptively identify asymptomatic infections\n\nIn other words, allowing the use of self-test kits is an effective way to screen and identify asymptomatic patients. \n\nLondon also approved the use of self testing kit for COVID-19 to fulfill the same goal. \n\nThe aim of the initial rollout of the tests was not only to ... rebalance protectional costs to sector, but also to reduce unnecessary transmission- putting extra burden on what was already a very saturated health service back then. It was also the beginning of the second lockdown, due to the number of new daily cases averaging at 22,000 and peaking at 400.\nSchools returned in March this year with a lot of worries from those students and their families. Not to mention teachers, of course. In which the government aided them with lateral flow tests with the go ahead \n      \nBut the accuracy of the home test kits sparked controversy in the U.K. Recently a research team at the University of Birmingham tested about 8000 students and concluded that the sensitivity of the kits is 3.2 percent. \n\nHannah NAM / Pharmacist \n\nThe sensitivity of this particular lateral flow test we use ranges from 58 to 79% depending on who is actually performing the test. Whether it may be a trained healthcare staff or individuals who are following step by step guides.\n\nEven though the MHRA have approved the use of the lateral flow tests at home, they emphasize that the negative test results should not be used as evidence for people to stop being less cautious of the current situation.\n\nThose who received negative from the FDA-authorized self-testing kits are allowed to visit the U.S\n\nThere is a mixed response towards the Self-testing kits. Opinions of those who believe the kits will be effective and those who disagree are tight. Meanwhile, the US decided to allow the entry of those who were received 'negative' from the Self-testing Kits\n\nIn Korea, coronavirus self-test kits are first being introduced preferentially to high-risk groups\n\nHow to make self-test kits more useful?\n\nExperts advise that to make COVID-19 self-test kits more useful, there are more that needs to be done.  \n\nLEE, Hyuk-min, Professor / Dept. of Laboratory Medicine, Severance Hospital\n\nYou don\u2019t get hurt by using the self-test kits. Everyone who gets negative from the test should all take PCR tests separately. What we can expect from the kits subsidiarily is to build a system of tracking patients with Coronavirus and encourage them to report their condition\n\nIt is important to note that COVID-19 self-testing kits are subsidiary tools. Keep in mind to take PCR tests when experiencing suspicious symptoms and abide by quarantine guidelines.",

Even when looking at sales for the past three to four years, average annual sales grew by about 26 percent. Also in terms of job satisfaction, we received a high score of 9-point-8 last year from our employees.\" \n\nOther companies have also introduced a partial four-day week. \nBoth Kakao Games and some of SK Group's affiliates have a four-day week every other week, \nWoowa Brothers, operator of South Korea's largest food delivery app, is letting its workers take time off every Monday morning. \n\n(KOR- \ub0a8\uc790)\uc2a4\uce74\uc774\ud504 \ud45c\uc2dc\n \"I have a new born baby and we have to go for regular check-ups. So, I usually make my appointments Monday morning. If it were not for the 4-and-a-half-day week, I would have to ask for a day off every time.\" \n\nMany employees prefer a compressed work schedule rather than working 9-to-6, Monday-to-Friday.  \nIn a recent survey of over a thousand workers, 88-point-3 percent said they would like to work four days and enjoy a three-day weekend.\n\n(Stand-up)\n\"But some say that a broad acceptance of a four-day week may be easier said than done.\"\n\n(\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc788\ub294 \uc804\ud654\uc778\ud130\ubdf0 - KOR - \ub0a8\uc790) \n \"The most important thing is whether industries can operate under flexible working hours. But not all can. So, there will be different preferences for a four-day week or a five-day week depending on a company's business model or the nature of their work.\"\n\n Countries are also looking into trim their workweek on a national level. \nJapan is considering granting employees a day off every week, and Spain plans to launch a pilot four-day week as early as this September. \nMin Suk-hyen, Arirang News.",

He said negotiations are ongoing between the NUG and international organizations and governments to formally recognize the NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar. Tell us about the progress that's been made.\n\n Tell us about the role of the 'People's Defense Force' as the NUG's military wing. I know it's too early to tell, but is it succeeding in protecting civilians from military violence? What are your prospects for the defense force?\n\n Criticisms are mounting that occasional statements of concern from countries and the UN Security Council isn't enough in stopping the bloody crackdown in Myanmar. Questions are also rising on the ASEAN's commitment as it still awaits the appointment of envoy to be sent to Myanmar. How do you assess the efforts being made by the international community?\n\nAround 100 days into the crisis, and we're still hearing a lot of reports on senseless violence on innocent civilians. Detainees are being starved, beaten and even burned alive. Tell us more about the grave situation there. \n\n Today marks the 41st anniversary since the May 18 Democratic Movement in South Korea, and many are comparing the movement to the current anti-coup uprising in Myanmar. What does the May 18 movement mean to Myanmar's fight for democracy?\n\n Daw Zin Mar Aung, foreign minister of the National Unity Government joining us from Myanmar. Thank you.",

Thanks for coming on today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Stocks in New York ended last Friday with a nice bounce back after a week of declines. All three of the main indices closing higher for the day, but still lower for the week. What's the story in global markets, and your outlook for the days ahead?\n\n \n\n\n\n Today in Korea, stocks are a little lower on selling by foreigners and institutions. Retail investors, though, seeing another chance to buy. Tell us about the local market.\n\n \n\n\n\n With concerns about rates rising in the U.S. to deal with inflation, there are concerns about what that would do to Korean households and their growing debts. We also need to look ahead at what the Biden administration might do in terms of trade and climate change. What do you see ahead in those terms, and what might need to be done about it?\n\n \n\n\n\n It's the start of a new week professor. We'll have data out on Korean households and how they faired financially in the first quarter, so we should see to what degree the income gap is improving or otherwise. What's on your radar in the days ahead?",

South Korean Lee Kyoung-hoon has entered the winner's circle for the first time on the PGA Tour.\nAt the AT&T Byron Nelson, Lee shot a six-under 66 in the final round. \nHe finished at 25-under 263\u2026 beating American Sam Burns by three strokes.\nIt was Lee's 80th career start on the tour and he is now the eighth South Korean man to find a PGA win.\nThe final round was suspended for nearly two-and-a-half hours due to heavy rain in the area. \nLee had left himself a par attempt on the 16th hole when the play was halted but missed.\nBut, he hit eight birdies overall, including five on the first nine and two on the final two holes to seal the win.\n\nTo swimming now, South Korean swimming sensation Hwang Sun-woo has booked his place at this year's Olympics. Just 18-years-old and already a two-time national record holder?\n\nYes, quite the feat. As you say, South Korean swimming sensation Hwang Sun-woo is heading to the Tokyo Olympics.\nHwang Sun-woo on Sunday broke his own world junior record in the 200-meter freestyle at 1 minute 44-point-96 seconds.\nThis after finishing first on Saturday in the men's 100-meter freestyle at a national team selection competition.\nIn finishing first Hwang qualifies for Tokyo 2020 while also setting a new Korean record of 48-point-zero-4 seconds\nThe previous record of 48-point-28 was set by Hwang a year earlier\u2026 beating Park Tae-hwan.\nHe now ranks as the 7th fastest man in the world.\n\nThe Olympics are only 67 days away and there is still a lot of public discontent due to the COVID-19 situation in Japan. Now, a CEO from one of Japan's leading e-commerce firms is voicing his concern?\n\n Yes, the head of Japan's e-commerce giant Rakuten has warned that holding the Tokyo Olympics this summer would be a \"suicide mission.\"\nSpeaking to CNN on Saturday, Hiroshi Mikitani said holding the Games amid the pandemic is \u201cdangerous,\u201d and that the risk is \u201ctoo big.\u201d\nOn the same day, a petition to cancel the Tokyo Olympics... with more than 351-thousand signatures... was submitted to the city's governor.\nIn other news, the U.S. Track and Field Team last week decided to cancel it\u2019s training camp in Japan due to safety concerns.\nThe team was due to stay in Chiba, the prefecture next to Tokyo, but withdrew due to concerns over the risk of COVID-19 infection.\n\n And finally, there was a Korean Derby in MLB over the weekend and the first of its kind in two years. What can you tell us about that?\n\n Yes, there was a rare Korean pitcher-batter duel in MLB on Sunday local time.\nKim Ha-seong of the San Diego Padres faced off against Kim Kwang-hyun of the St. Louis Cardinals.\nAt Petco Park in San Diego, with the bases loaded in the bottom of the fourth and the Cardinals up 2-1, Kim Ha-seong worked a six-pitch walk against his fellow countryman.\nKim Kwang-hyun then struck out Kim Ha-seong to open the third inning. \nThe battle went on for eight pitches and, eventually, Kim Ha-seong went on to record the win, 5-3 to the Padres. \nIt first meeting between a South Korean pitcher and a South Korean batter in the majors since April 2019.\nElsewhere in MLB, Tamba Rays' Choi Ji-man on Sunday returned from injury to collect three hits in his season debut.\nChoi batted 3-for-4 with an RBI and a run against the New York Mets at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, contributing to a 7-1 victory. \n\n Thank-you for that, Paul. We shall see you again next week.\n\n Thank you.",

Kyung-eun... health authorities have VOWED... BROADER COVERAGE... of TREATMENT COSTS... for COVID-19 vaccine-related... side effects?\n \n That's right. \nPreviously, the government provided compensation... to those who develop severe side effects,\u2026and only when those symptoms were proven to be caused by vaccines.\n There have been two such cases,\u2026 so far. \nBut starting this week,... those who develop severe reactions are eligible to receive... up to 9 thousand U.S. dollars,... even if there's insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship. \nThey DO NOT include cases that may have been caused by other factors\u2026 such as underlying health conditions,... or clearly has no link to the vaccines.\nThe broader coverage... is aimed at ENGENDERING more public trust... in the country's vaccination campaign. \n\n(KOREAN) May 17, 2021 \n \"These measures are aimed at strengthening the state's accountability,... and apply to those who've been hospitalized in ICUs after getting vaccinated,\u2026 but have been unable to receive compensation due to insufficient evidence... to establish a causal link between the vaccines and their conditions.\" \n\n Authorities say... there are currently five people who are eligible for compensation... under this new criteria. \nThey include a 45-year-old nursing assistant who got the AstraZeneca jab,\u2026 and suffered paralysis in her arms and legs,...for a short time,.. but has since recovered.\nThe government also plans to go over PREVIOUSLY-REVIEWED cases... to see if anyone else may be eligible.\nPeople can apply for compensation more than once,\u2026 unless the total payout exceeds 9 thousand dollars.\nBut the coverage DOES NOT extend to the cost of treating pre-existing conditions,... or for nursing and funeral expenses.\n\n AND...

He joins us live from Toledo, Ohio.\nWilliam Adams, pleasure to have you with us. \n\n (Toledo, Ohio/ Skype) \n\n Inflation concerns are back in the U.S. with its consumer prices rising at their fastest pace in 12 years. This is a rate much higher than many had expected. What are some of the main contributing factors?\n\n The Federal Reserve played down expectations of tighter policy saying the price rise is \"transitory and temporary.\"  How long do you project the \"transitory\" period of inflation pressures to last, and would inflation become a major problem?\n\n The soaring inflation in the U.S. has prompted fears over interest rate hikes. What's your forecast?\n\n How would rising inflation and possible rate hike in the U.S. impact the global economy, and what does it mean specifically for Asia?\n\n William Adams, Senior Economist at the PNC Financial Services Group for us tonight.

        "artcl_ctt": "What started as peaceful protests against a military regime that imposed martial law here in Korea,... 41 years ago, turned into a bloody massacre in the southwestern city of Gwangju.\nOn May 18th, military forces deployed to the city began a brutal crackdown on students and Gwangju citizens calling for democracy.\nOver ten terrible days, the people fought back and soldiers opened fire on citizens, leaving over 193 people dead and over 3,000 wounded.\nThe regime stayed in power, at the time, but the spirit of the movement lived on as a symbol of democracy -- in Korea and around the world.\nAcross the globe, however, we are seeing more and more autocratic regimes coming to power, with some eerily similar scenes in Myanmar, after a military coup in February this year sparked massive demonstrations.\nWe discuss the two movements and what the world can do to better support the people of Myanmar today.\nFor this, we have Ye Naing, a Burmese postgraduate student here in South Korea, and acclaimed investigative journalist Tim Shorrock who has been covering Korean Peninsula issues since the 1970s and was named an honorary citizen of Gwangju in 2015 for his work in uncovering the truth about the May 18th movement.\n\n\n1. Ye Naing: When you last left Myanmar, your family and friends were living under an elected government, and there was hope in the international community that the country would continue its democratic transition. But now, it's been over 100 days since the military coup took place. It must have been a worrying time for you. \n\n2. Ye Naing: How has the coup changed your situation here in Korea?\n\n3. Tim: In 2015, you became an honorary citizen of Gwangju for your tireless contribution to uncovering the truth of the military\u2019s violent crackdown and for globalising the spirit of the May 18th movement. What would you describe as the \u201cspirit of the Gwangju movement\u201d?\n\n4. Tim: You\u2019ve been observing the demonstrations in Myanmar, where a military junta ousted a democratically elected government, and began cracking down on protestors and journalists. It must bring back memories for you. What has it been like for you, watching these events unfold, and what are some important similarities and differences that you see?\n\n5. Ye Naing: You are here in Korea where we also went through a phase of military oppression and rule -- one of the most significant events being the Gwangju Democratisation Movement on May 18th. Does this hold any meaning for you?\n\n6. Ye Naing: How are Burmese students like yourself supporting your loved ones back home?\n\n7. Tim: Like the people of Gwangju four decades ago, the Burmese people seem to be on their own in fighting this battle for democracy. The UN Security Council has failed to take a joint stand against the coup and Western countries don\u2019t seem to be doing more than sanctioning military officials to little effect. What would you like to see the international community do to help?\n\n8. Ye Naing: What do you hope to see the international community actually do, rather than simply talking about a response?\n\nThat was Ye Naing, a Burmese postgraduate student here in South Korea, and American investigative journalist Tim Shorrock. Thank you for your time.\n(Suwon)  - \ub179\ud654 \n\n(Washington, D.C.)",

Being types of spice,... they are too pungent and take away the other ingredients' own smells and flavors.\"\n\nAttracted by the healthy recipes,... the acclaimed culinary school Le Cordon Bleu London has decided to teach Korea\u2019s temple cuisine as part of its regular course. \nThe school has signed an MOU with the Cultural Corps of Korean Buddhism and Korean Cultural Centre UK to offer at least one Korean temple food lecture per semester as part of a plant-based culinary arts program. \n\n(ENGLISH/\ub0a8)\n\"At the moment in Western world, especially in UK, vegan food is so popular. They are so interested in cuisines from the world that use vegetables. As you know, the Korean temple food is very plant-based and using locally-grown ingredients.\"\n\nVenerable Beop Song,... the instructor for the first lecture in late April,... says she would like to further show the benefits of Korean temple food.\n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec) \n\"I want to let European to-be chefs know about the Korean culture of getting ingredients directly from outdoors and eating after just simply mixing and boiling them. We do natural seasoning,... and the recipes are very simple. Food is the least important for practitioners,... but if we need to eat, we value the ingredients' own flavor.\"\n\nHealthy Korean temple cuisine is becoming a bridge to let the world know more about a wider range of Korean culture, with other schools like Westminster Kingsway College contacting the Korean Cultural Centre UK to host Korean cuisine workshops.\nKim Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.",

So, we\u2019re seeing a lot of companies trying to disperse their employees across separate work locations.\nThe wider adoption of teleworking is also a key factor.\n\nWe still have five-day workweeks, but we\u2019ll likely see much more flexible work schedules in the coming future.\nIn light of these trends, the demand for shared workspaces will continue to increase in the years ahead, even after the pandemic.",

Being types of spice,... they are too pungent and take away the other ingredients' own smells and flavors.\"\n\nAttracted by the healthy recipes,... the acclaimed culinary school Le Cordon Bleu London has decided to teach Korea\u2019s temple cuisine as part of its regular course. \nThe school has signed an MOU with the Cultural Corps of Korean Buddhism and Korean Cultural Centre UK to offer at least one Korean temple food lecture per semester as part of a plant-based culinary arts program. \n\n(ENGLISH/\ub0a8)\n\"At the moment in Western world, especially in UK, vegan food is so popular. They are so interested in cuisines from the world that use vegetables. As you know, the Korean temple food is very plant-based and using locally-grown ingredients.\"\n\nVenerable Beop Song,... the instructor for the first lecture in late April,... says she would like to further show the benefits of Korean temple food.\n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec) \n\"I want to let European to-be chefs know about the Korean culture of getting ingredients directly from outdoors and eating after just simply mixing and boiling them. We do natural seasoning,... and the recipes are very simple. Food is the least important for practitioners,... but if we need to eat, we value the ingredients' own flavor.\"\n\nHealthy Korean temple cuisine is becoming a bridge to let the world know more about a wider range of Korean culture, with other schools like Westminster Kingsway College contacting the Korean Cultural Centre UK to host Korean cuisine workshops.\nKim Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.",

If I'm good enough to go out after my junior year, I will go. If not, I'm just gonna stay another year.

But in a few years, I expect them to rise. Even if things don't work out, I think he's at least a future second round pick.\"\n\nRooting for him is not only his mother, 1984 Olympic basketball silver medalist Sung Jung-a, but also NBA superstar Stephen Curry, a fellow Davidson Wildcat who once gave him some tips on Zoom.\n\n(ENGLISH\ub0a8)\n\"One thing he said was, 'Just enjoy it.' As I said, if you have haters, let them motivate you. Don't feel the pressure and just enjoy it. That's what he said.\"\n\nLee Hyun-jung's hoop dream starts with playing in the NBA, but it doesn't end there.\nThe end goal is to inspire other Korean athletes to aim high, just like him.\n\n(ENGLISH\ub0a8)\n\"We got a lot of stereotypes that Asians can't play in the NBA. You know what I'm saying?... I just want to say if you're Asian and you can't jump high or something. Work on the other stuff. Ball-handling like Jeremy Lin or shooting like me?

        "artcl_ctt": "Hello, greetings to all, my name is Lee Jeehyun the weather caster at arirang TV. I\u2019m here today to introduce Arirang\u2019s disaster CCTV broadcasting system.  \n\nArirang\u2019s disaster CCTV broadcasting system was developed EXCLUSIVELY by ARIRANG TV by applying nation\u2019s disaster broadcasting system. That means, we can Check LIVE CCTV anytime 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to keep the viewers updated. \n\nRight now, you are looking at 35 places across Korea from, Korea\u2019s southern most islands on Jeju, \ub9c8\ub77c\ub3c4 TO eastern most islands of \uc6b8\ub989\ub3c4. \n\nWhy don\u2019t we take a closer look at couple of places?\n (\uc67c\ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9)\nToday is May 16th, early summer weather here, not much going on in terms of the weather conditions. \n\nBut let\u2019s check Marado, the southern most islets of Jeju, the place I\u2019ve never been as well...Beautiful day with sunshine.. but if it was pouring down because the typhoon was on the way with high waves, Imagine how looking at this video can really motivate people to stay alert rather than just verbally delivering the message. \n(\ubc31\ub4dc\ub86d \uac00\uc6b4\ub370\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9 ? \ubc31\ub4dc\ub86d\uc740 35\uac1c \ud654\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \ubc14\ub01c)\nSo by adopting this system, NOW arirang tv can deliver up to date details to foreign residents in Korea, protect lives and property from natural disaster. Additionally, we can give more reliable reports to foreigners living abroad. \n                 (\ubc31\ub4dc\ub86d \uc67c\ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOn that note, let me take you to bapo hangang park, where flooding is a regular occurrence, during monsoon season. It\u2019s a calm day but when there is heavy rain, water levels of HanRiver could spike up suddenly and could get submerged underwater. And with Arirang\u2019s disaster CCTV broadcasting system, we can keep up to date with latest situation during news cast.\n\n(\ubc31\ub4dc\ub86d \uac00\uc6b4\ub370\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9 ? \ubc31\ub4dc\ub86d\uc740 35\uac1c \ud654\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \ubc14\ub01c)\n  As a weather caster, \nWhen I do a weather reporting on extreme days.. dusty days to heavy snowy day, or on a day when the weather varies from place to place, I\u2019ve always wished there were better ways to deliver the reports other than numbers and words but NOW with Arirang\u2019s disaster CCTV broadcasting system, we can present accurate and reliable weather and information to international community. Lastly, Arirangtv/radio will continue to fulfill the role befitting its rising national status. Thank you.",

I'm trying to be that guy who works on the unseen hours like Kobe Bryant. Taking like a thousand or two thousand, three thousand.\"\n\nIn 22 games played during his sophomore season in NCAA Division 1 basketball, Lee scored 44.2 percent of shots he took from three-point range.\nHe also averaged 50.8 percent in field goal percentage and 90 percent from the free throw line.\nHad he played a few more games, that would have been good enough to become the eleventh member of the NCAA's exclusive 50-40-90 club.\nHis marksmanship has landed him on the South Korean national team and insiders are wondering when the 20 year-old will enter the NBA draft.\n\n(ENGLISH\ub0a8)\n\"It depends on what the NBA scouts or the team says. If I'm good enough to go out after my junior year, I will go. If not, I'm just gonna stay another year. We'll see.\"\n\nMock drafts currently have Lee as a potential second round pick, a view shared by former Portland Trailblazer and Korea's first ever NBA player Ha Seung-jin.\n\n(KOREAN\ub0a8-\uc804\ud654 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0)\n\"Lee's still a sophomore so I'm aware his draft predictions are low at the moment. But in a few years, I expect them to rise. Even if things don't work out, I think he's at least a future second round pick.\"\n\nRooting for him is not only his mother, 1984 Olympic basketball silver medalist Sung Jung-a, but also NBA superstar Stephen Curry, a fellow Davidson Wildcat who once gave him some tips on Zoom.\n\n(ENGLISH\ub0a8)\n\"One thing he said was, 'Just enjoy it.' As I said, if you have haters, let them motivate you. Don't feel the pressure and just enjoy it. That's what he said.\"\n\nLee Hyun-jung's hoop dream starts with playing in the NBA, but it doesn't end there.\nThe end goal is to inspire other Korean athletes to aim high, just like him.\n\n(ENGLISH\ub0a8)\n\"We got a lot of stereotypes that Asians can't play in the NBA. You know what I'm saying?... I just want to say if you're Asian and you can't jump high or something. Work on the other stuff. Ball-handling like Jeremy Lin or shooting like me? I don't know.\"\n\nHan Seong-woo, Arirang News.",

Thank you for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Let's start with the markets. Stocks in New York closed a little lower, though not as low as they were mid-session. It seems a lot of investors are worried about valuations, interest rates, and maybe a move away from tech. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n \n\n\n\n Despite that decline on Wall Street, Korean stocks were up today, the KOSPI by about one-and-a-quarter percent. This time it looks like it was institutions maybe looking for some bargains. Tell us about the local market.\n\n\n\n\n\n We're getting more comments on the economic recovery from officials at the Fed. The Fed's Vice Chair, Richard Clarida, says jobs are still down about 8 million from a year ago, but he also thinks the Fed can boost employment without driving prices too much higher. Where do you see Fed policy headed in the coming months?\n\n\n\n\n\n We're seeing a little uptick in oil prices right now. Contracts for West Texas crude for next month up about 1-point-4 percent. What do you see happening with oil in the near term?",

The KDCA cleared the air today, saying that the U.S. currently exempts quarantine for all of those who got vaccines approved by the WHO which includes, AZ vaccine. \nHow do you see the selective quarantine exemptions by countries depending on vaccine type?\n\n The KDCA also said it's reviewing quarantine exemption for inbound travellers who received vaccines approved by the WHO... and that talks are ongoing with other countries on reciprocal approval of travellers inoculated with those vaccines. What are your biggest concerns about this?\n\n The U.S. CDC's lifting of outdoor and indoor mask guideline for fully vaccinated people is sparking confusion in the country with some experts arguing that it's too early and dangerous. What's your take on lifting mandatory mask wearing for fully vaccinated people?\n\n How much of the U.S. population had to be vaccinated for the CDC to lift mask wearing? When could South Koreans begin to live without masks?\n\n The education ministry is pushing for in-person classes of all grades, from kindergartens to high schools, from the fall semester. The KDCA remains a bit more cautious, saying it depends on the infection curve. What's your take?\n\n Dr. Tan, thank you as always for your insights.",

Korea reports 654 more cases of new coronavirus, total now at 133,471: KDCA\nS. Korea reports 8 additional coronavirus death, total now at 1,912: KDCA\n606 more patients released from coronavirus treatment, total now at 123,237: KDCA.",

Seoul is seeking to swiftly revive the peace process on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n Attention is also on whether the U.S. will seek South Korea's participation in the so-called Quad to counter China's rising influence.\nThe summit will be followed by a joint press conference.\n\n On the same day, Moon will also sit down for talks with Vice President Kamala Harris... and attend a ceremony for the construction of the Wall of Remembrance at the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.\nOn Saturday, the president will meet with the first African-American cardinal Wilton Gregory -- the archbishop of Washington.\n\n Before returning home, Moon is expected to make a stopover at Atlanta to visit South Korean battery maker SK Innovation's factory.\nHe will arrive back in Seoul on Sunday evening. \nKim Min-ji, Arirang News.",

Troy: Chipmaking is set to be a major point of discussion between the two countries. Samsung is expected to make a $17 billion investment to build a semiconductor plant in the U.S. How important is building a \"chip democracy\" to America right now, especially given the global supply shortage?\n\n2. Jun-sok: What will the 17 billion dollar investment mean for both sides?\n\n3. Troy: What advantages can Samsung and SK Hynix offer to the U.S.? How do you see this chip cooperation play out?\n\n4. Jun-sok: Currently, South Korean firms specialise in memory chips. How can they increase their competitiveness in foundries?\n\n5. Troy: As trade becomes more and more intertwined with security issues, how do you see the U.S. reconfiguring its economic relations with allied countries? \n\n6. Jun-sok: As the U.S. aims to move away from trade with China, how do you see it reconfiguring its supply chains in new technologies? Do you think the U.S. will pursue a more multilateral framework of economic cooperation among democracies?\n\n\n7. Troy: What economic initiatives or areas do you see Seoul and Washington cooperating on, in particular?\nWhat do you think the U.S. will ask of South Korean companies that are in America this week during the summit period?\n\n8. Jun-sok: What are areas the U.S. could cooperate on with South Korea?\n\nThat was Troy Stangarone, Senior Director and Fellow at the Korea Economic Institute, and Yang Junsok, Professor of Economics at The Catholic University of Korea.\nThank you for your time.\n(Tennessee)\n\n(Seoul) - \ub179\ud654",

Ambassador to the United Nations.\nEvans J.R. Revere, Former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\n\n1. Ambassador Oh: The U.S. has been seeking to strengthen its alliances in the Asia Pacific region amid its competition with China, and Mr. Biden will push for South Korea to join the Quad in his summit with Moon. Meanwhile, many South Koreans are hoping this meeting will result in a \u201cvaccine swap\u201d agreement where Korea could borrow some of America's surplus supplies. How important is this for Moon and do you think the two presidents could meet in the middle?\n\n2. Mr. Revere: South Korea is still scarred by its experience in 2016 when the country stood by the U.S. and adopted the THAAD anti-missile defense system, then faced economically devastating consequences from Beijing. Do you think Mr. Biden might provide any economic reassurances, or some form of vaccine agreement?\n\n3. Mr. Revere: What are some commitments Mr. Biden would want to see from South Korea, amid Washington's technological and geopolitical rivalry with Beijing?\n\n4. Ambassador Oh: Until now, the U.S. has kept out of the bilateral spat between Seoul and Tokyo over contentious territorial and historical issues. Will Mr. Biden have to become more involved if he wants to strengthen the trilateral alliance? \n\n5. Mr. Revere: Japan\u2019s recent decision to release radioactive wastewater into the Pacific with Washington\u2019s support has triggered more disappointment for the South Koreans who already felt a sense of being the lesser ally. Do you think Mr. Biden is planning to do more to bring the two countries together? \n\n6. Ambassador Oh: The U.S. completed its North Korea policy review and said it would take a \u201ccalibrated, practical approach\u201d to dealing with the regime. We have yet to hear the specifics of this strategy but how do you think a practical approach would look? \n\n7. Mr. Revere: What would you consider a practical approach, and what mistakes should Washington avoid repeating? \n\n8. Ambassador Oh: Mr. Biden has stressed the importance of improving human rights in North Korea. How do you think the regime will respond to pressure on this front? Do you see any possibility of progress?\n\nThat was Oh Joon, Professor at Kyung Hee University and South Korea's Fmr. Ambassador to the United Nations, and Evans J.R. Revere, Former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\nThank you both for your time.\n(Seoul)\n\n(New Jersey) - \ub179\ud654",

This type of robot will eventually be used more in the service sector. So, we have developed robots for cooking and filming, and we are planning to produce the one for the art sector which can better interact with people.\" \n\nExperts say that the use of collaborative robots could result in human job losses in the short-term, but create more jobs in the long-term.\n\n(Korean-\ub0a8\uc790)\n\"If you recall how the auto industry first emerged, horsemen lost their jobs. The emergence of cars took their jobs away, but in the long run, the auto industry created higher added value, and ended up providing more jobs. Collaborative robots could create the same situation.\"\n\nCollaborative robots are being used overseas in rehabilitation and crafting tattoos, indicating that the market still has plenty of room to expand. \nSeo Eunkyung, Arirang News.",

Thank you for coming on today.\n\n Good afternoon.\n\n According to the minutes from last month's meeting of the Fed Open Markets Committee, some members say they will be open to discussions about tapering in future meetings. That means, of course, less bond-buying as the economy recovers. And officials still think that the inflation we see will be temporary. Tell us what you make of this news from the Fed.\n\n\n\n At the start of this year, the 10 year Treasury rose back to one percent. By March it was at 1-point-7. The question, of course, is whether we are already on the rising part of the interest rate cycle. What can you tell us about the timing of these rising rates, or otherwise, what do you make of the situation?\n\n\n\n Stocks on Wall Street were down for a third session in a row on Thursday. The Dow by about half a percent, but less of a decline in tech. The Nasdaq was basically unchanged. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n \n\n Today in Korea, quite a similar story to Wall Street. The KOSPI off about point-3 a percent, but the tech-heavy KOSDAQ actually posting a slight gain. It looks like retail investors seeing a chance to buy while others sold. Tell us about the local market.\n\n\n\n The price of gold has risen quite a bit in the past few months. Now about the highest it's been this year. It seems some investors are looking to hedge against inflation. On the other hand, there's been a meltdown in the cryptocurrency space over the past week. What do you see happening with these alternative assets?",

It's reportedly fixed its plan to pump billions of dollars to building 3 and 2-nanometer semiconductor foundries in the U.S. Would this have an impact on Samsung's U.S. investment plan at all?\n\n Why are major South Korean investments in battery and chips so important for President Biden?\nAnd, how do we expect the U.S. to reciprocate? \n\n Jeff Moon, President of China Moon Strategies live from Washington for us. Thank you.\n\n(STUDIO)\n Let's take things and view it from a bigger perspective. How will South Korea, U.S. partnership and commitment to enhance technology capabilities impact the supply chain and the wider market?\nLet's bring in Waqas Adenwala, Asia Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\nHe joins us live from Singapore.\nWaqas, great to have you again on the show. \n\n(Singapore)\n \n\n Samsung is expected to pledge 17 billion-dollar investment in building chip plants in the U.S. while Taiwan's TSMC has reportedly doubled down on its plan to pump billions of dollars in building chip foundries in U.S. \nWhat do these deals mean to the global semiconductor industry that's facing an unprecedented shortage crisis?\n\n South Korean battery maker SK Innovation and Ford Motor are reportedly set to launch a battery joint venture in the United States while LG energy solution is planning to build more battery plants in the U.S. after jointly building a factory with GM Motors. \nAs three South Korean firms take up over one third of the global battery market share - LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK Innovation, that is - how would growing S. Korea-U.S. battery partnership impact the global market?\n\n The Biden administration is aggressively seeking allies' cooperation in boosting U.S. chip supply as part of efforts to compete with China which produces over 35-percent of the world's semiconductors. Currently over 70-percent of chips are made in Asian countries, including China. How do you expect the global chip making landscape to change in the coming years?\n\n Waqas Adenwala, Asia Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit for us tonight. Waqas, many thanks to you.",

What prompted the start of the Qoos and why did you decide to focus on the U.S. market? \n\n What have you learned so far through the data collected by your app 'The Qoos'? Any notable aspects about the K-pop fan base in the U.S.?\n\n Goldhouse, a nonprofit collective seeking to protect Asian identity and promote cultural diversity, has named BLACKPINK and director of \"Minari\", Lee Isaac Chung as one of the 100 most impactful Asians of the year. And along with big name K-culture celebrities on the list was 'K-pop fandom' recognized for its influence for social good solely through the power of digital platforms. How do you see this trend of K-pop fandom expanding across digital platforms? \n\n You also worked as a U.S. business director at YG Entertainment seeking Korean-American collaboration in various fields, from music to the fashion industry. Tell us some interesting episodes, and how did you bridge the gap between the two markets?\n\nIn a recently released report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, South Korea was named as the fastest-growing major music market in the world in 2020. And according to the Korea Customs Service, global K-Pop album sales jumped 60% globally between 2019 and 2020 with a 90% increase in the U.S. alone. How do you see this?\n\n It is hard to imagine K-pop getting bigger than it already has become but what are your prospects for the future of K-pop, and what needs be done for a long-term success of the K-pop industry?\n\n Thank you for sharing your perspective with us tonight.",

But they also will discuss climate. They will also discuss economic partnership. They will also discuss China. And those will all be a part of this bilateral conversation and meeting tomorrow.\"\n\n Prior to the summit, Moon will hold talks with Vice President Kamala Harris.\nHe will also attend a White House ceremony -- where Biden will award the first Medal of Honor of his presidency -- to a U.S. veteran of the Korean War.\n It will be given to Colonel Ralph Puckett Jr.,... who, in a battle in late 1950, deliberately drew enemy fire by running across an open area three times, so his unit could locate and destroy enemy positions.\n On Friday evening, Moon will attend a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the Wall of Remembrance at the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.\nKim Min-ji, Arirang News.",

So far we know that the Biden administration will build its North Korea policy on 2018 Singapore agreement while \"respecting\" the Panmunjeom Declaration... and tailor a \"pragmatic\" approach with \"maximum flexibility\". Did we get more clues from the summit as to how the administration specifically plans to resolve the nuclear deadlock? What's your assessment of Biden's North Korea policy?\n\n3. The summit was also seen by many as a chance for the two leaders to address existing cleavages in their North Korea policy. What are the remaining differences, and would those issues have been brought to the table?\n\n4. Much attention was drawn to which denuclearization term Biden would use after the summit-- CVID (Complete, Verifiable, Irreversible Denuclearization) or CVIA with the term 'Abandonment'. North Korea strongly rejects the term CVID, but has once made concession and accepted the term CVIA during the Bush administration in 2005 after 6-party talks. How do you analyze the terms used in the statement?\n\n5. Expected reaction from North Korea on summit results?\n\n6. In your perspective, is the U.S.-led regional forum, the Quad an opportunity or a crisis for South Korea?\n\n\n Ambassador Robert Gallucci, Professor of Diplomacy at Georgetown and previously U.S. Ambassador-at-Large and Special Envoy for the U.S. Department of State, many thanks for your insights and expertise. We appreciate it.",

South Korea's top four conglomerates, Samsung, SK, LG and Hyundai are largely expected to announce sizable investments in new factories on U.S. soil-- to set the stage for the first summit between presidents Moon and Biden. \nAlthough the details are yet to be confirmed, what do you expect from Thursday's meeting?\n\n2. Samsung is expected to pledge a 17 billion-dollar investment in building chip plants in the U.S. while Taiwan's TSMC has reportedly doubled down on its plan to pump billions of dollars into building chip foundries in the U.S. \nPresident Joe Biden, who has vowed to provide 50 billion dollars to support the U.S. chip industry, is pushing its allies' chip cooperation even more aggressively than his predecessor, Donald Trump. \nWhy are semiconductors so important to Biden?\n\n3. At the heart of Biden's 'chip diplomacy' lies growing U.S.-China competition for global chip hegemony. How would China react to the results of S. Korea-U.S. summit, and how can S. Korea balance its relations with Washington and Beijing?\n\n4. Covid vaccines are among the top agendas of the S. Korea-U.S. summit, and President Moon has vowed that he will turn the talks into South Korea's opportunity to become the 'global hub' of vaccine production. \nDo you think the two sides' vaccine partnership will go beyond vaccine swaps and reach vaccine technology transfer deals? \n\n5. The global race for vaccines and semiconductors is expanding the conventional military alliance of South Korea and the U.S. to other essential economic alliances. \nHow do you see the evolving nature of the Seoul-Washington alliance and its impact on regional security?\n\n6. South Korea and the U.S. confirmed that denuclearization efforts will build on the 2018 Singapore agreement signed between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and former U.S. President Donald Trump. What kinds of agreements do you expect from the latest summit on North Korea's denuclearization?\n\n7. Differences remain between Seoul and Washington over major issues, including North Korea's human rights abuses and lifting of sanctions. \nDo you think these thorny issues will be brought to the table and will the two leaders could agree upon a unified denuclearization approach?\n\n  Professor Min Jeong-hun of Korea National Diplomatic Academy for us tonight.

Thank you for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Let's start with cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Treasury Department is taking steps to stop crypto from being used for money laundering. The Treasury wants the exchanges to report any transaction worth more than 10-thousand dollars to the IRS. The price of Bitcoin is down about 25 percent over the past week, but since the Treasury said this, the price is holding fairly steady. Tell us more about that if you could.\n\n\n\n\n\nStocks in New York were up on Thursday, breaking a three-day losing streak. The S&P up by a little over 1 percent, and that Nasdaq almost 1-point-8 percent. What's the story in the global markets?\n\n\n\n\n\n Here in Korea, the markets started out quite a bit higher, seeming to take their cue from Wall Street. But a little before mid-day they went straight down into negative territory and that's where the session ended. Tell us about that. What happened there?\n\n\n\n\n\n Before we go, let's look at new data on Korea's exports. In the first twenty days of this month, they were up 50 percent from the same time a year ago. They've been up every month since November, led again by semiconductors, cars and petroleum products. What do you see in this export data?",

        "artcl_ctt": "It's Friday,... and for those of you who are looking forward to some culture experience over the weekend, we turn to our regular 'Life With Culture' segment, with our culture correspondent Kim Bo-kyoung, who'se here in the studio with us.\nBo-kyoung welcome, what have you brought us today?\n\nHi, Mok-yeon,... since BTS released their second English language song \"Butter\" earlier today,... I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at a play based on Son Won-pyeong's novel \"Almond\"... (\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) which BTS were seen reading during the reality show \"In the SOOP - BTS\". Acclaimed worldwide and translated into around 15 languages,... the novel has also been made into a play, which is on at the Aram Nuri Arts Center in Goyang city. Let's take a look.\n\n\nAcclaimed by readers worldwide, the book \"Almond\" has been turned into a play,... sharing its coming-of-age story with the audience.\nThe book \"Almond\" was released in 2017 after winning the Changbi Publishers' Literary Award a year before.\nAfter that, Son Won-pyeong's novel was named as Amazon's Best Book of May 2020,... and was also awarded the prestigious 2020 Japanese Booksellers' Awards in the category of translated fiction novel.\nThe story's protagonist Yoon-jae was born with a small amygdala -- the part of the brain that looks like an almond. \nThis makes him emotionless, and the story shows his efforts to understand other people, especially through his friend Gon-ee.\n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8)\n\"Yoon-jae is an emotionless boy. He does not feel what other people easily feel - happiness, sadness and fear. I tried to deliver his emotionless mind. Yet he is always eager to know what others feel and tries to understand, so I focused to show such moves.\"\n\n(KOREAN/\ub0a8)\n\"Gon-ee knows how to feel, yet ironically he is quite similar to Yoon-jae in that he does not know how to express his feelings... leading him to keep making wrong choices.\n\nWhile the book focuses on Yoon-jae, the play uses other characters to deliver some of Yoon-jae's lines. It also puts the spotlight on the relationship between Yoon-jae and Gon-ee, showing how they each supplement what the other one lacks.  \n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"One of Yoon-jae's lines says the reason why we have not become monsters is because either we were holding others' hands or others were holding our hands. I hope the play can soothe people's minds during these tiring days.\" \n\nThe play is on until May 30th.\n(PKG\ub05d)\n\n(STUDIO)\n It'll must be very interesting to see how the novel has been adapted into a play. \nNow Bo-kyoung, are there any other performances that our viewers might be interested in?\n\nOf course,...  the annual Korea Opera Festival which was downsized last year showcasing only three pieces due to COVID-19, (\ud504\ub86c\ud130 \ubd04) has scaled back and this year will present six works focused mainly on women's lives.\nShows include one of the world's most-loved operas,... Puccini's \"Tosca\", set in Rome at the time of Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Italy, and the tragic story \"Anna Bolena\".\nThe festival runs until June 6th at Seoul Arts Center.\nMusical lovers will be excited to hear that \"Dracula\" -- a musical based on the famous novel -- kicked off just yesterday.\nThere had previously been worries that cases of COVID-19 among the cast would have led to the musical's another postponement.\nThe intertwined love story of Dracula unfolds against the backdrop of a Gothic castle... and is performed by well-known musical actors Kim Jun-su and Shin Sung-rok. \nToday,... Korean movie maniacs overseas might want to take a look at the 19th edition of the Florence Korea Film Fest, which showcases over a hundred Korean films. \nThis year the festival focuses on the late director Kim Ki-Duk and actress Moon So-ri.\nIt also features the screening of the first film by Oscar winner Bong Joon-ho -- \"Barking Dogs Never Bite\",... and an exclusive interview made for the festival.\n\nThank you Bo-kyoung for all that information. I will see you next week. \n\nThank you.",

Moon was hoping to get a lot out of this visit. Tell us more.\n\n Moon came to the States hoping to boost cooperation with the U.S. in COVID-19 vaccines to foster South Korea into a global hub for production.\n Seoul is among the world's best in terms of biological manufacturing capability -- and coupled with U.S. technology through a bilateral partnership -- it's hoping to create a synergy effect.\nAnother top priority for South Korea was to revive the stalled peace process on the Korean Peninsula -- which has seen no progress for over two years.\nHere's President Moon's opening remarks at the start of the expanded summit.\n\n(\uc790\ub9c9)\n \"South Korea will cooperate closely with the U.S. for complete denuclearization and the establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula. We face many difficult tasks, but as an alliance with shared values, we will actively cooperate to overcome COVID-19, revive the economy, address climate change and tackle other global issues to open a new era.\"\n\ud55c\ubc18\ub3c4\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ube44\ud575\ud654 \ud3c9\ud654 \uc815\ucc29\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud55c\uad6d\uc740 \ubbf8\uad6d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uae34\ubc00\ud788 \ud611\ub825\ud574 \ub098\uac08 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4 (\uc0dd\ub7b5) \uc27d\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\ub4e4\uc774 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc55e\uc5d0 \ub193\uc5ec\uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc591\uad6d\uc740 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\ub9f9\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ucf54\ub85c\ub098 \uadf9\ubcf5 \uacbd\uc81c \ud68c\ubcf5 \uae30\ud6c4\ubcc0\ud654 \ub300\uc751\uc744 \ube44\ub86f\ud55c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud604\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc801\uadf9 \ud611\ub825\ud560 \uac83\uc774\uba70 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\ub300\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5b4\uac08 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n Let's move on to the joint presser. What was the content of Moon's statement and give us a rundown of the questions he got from reporters on site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Another -- abolishing guidelines on South Korea's missile use before the end of Moon's term.\nSeoul has been banned from firing ballistic missiles with a range of over 800 kilometers under the agreement, which was first signed in 1979... in order to obtain U.S. missile technology.\nTermination of the agreement would pave the way for Seoul's missile sovereignty.\n\n\nBack to you, Conn-young.",

Surprisingly to some of us who have been following President Biden's stance on the previous administration's North Korea policy, the two leaders' joint statement reads the two reaffirm their common belief that diplomacy and dialogue based on previous inter-Korean and U.S.-DPRK commitments such as the 2018 Panmunjom Declaration and Singapore Joint Statement are essential to achieve the complete denuclearizatoin and establishment of permanent peace on the Korean peninsula.\nWhat are you making out of this?\n\n The biggest surprise from the joint statement was the appointment of Sung Kim as U.S. special envoy for North Korea, with the official name of the position being announced with the term 'DPRK'. Kim previously served as U.S. special representative for North Korea policy and also was the U.S. special envoy for the Six-Party Talks... being at the center of North Korea negotiations since the Bush administration. What are the implications of this to U.S. North Korea policy?\n\n As the world closely looks for more clues to Washington's 'pragmatic' denuclearization approach, President Biden stated that the U.S. will closely engage South Korea in North Korea strategy. But he drew the line to possible lifting of sanctions. What are you reading into this?\n\n While Seoul-Washington vaccine partnership is expected to give a big boost to production in Indo-Pacific region, the two countries also agreed to work closely to build supply network of chips, batteries and medicine. How do you assess the scope of their alliance expanding to other fields critical to national security, and how would the regional players be observing this?\n\n President Moon happily announced the abolishment of guidelines on South Korea's missile use that had been in place over the last 42 years. What significance does it hold to South Korea-U.S. military alliance and how will Asian neighbors respond?\n\n No official word about the U.S.-led regional forum, the Quad but it appears the elephant is always in the room. How can Seoul balance its relations with the U.S and China while keeping its feet close to the Quad but not officially stepping in?\n\n S. Korea and the U.S. have agreed to form a comprehensive vaccine partnership... with President Biden vowing to provide vaccines for 550,000 Korean soldiers, enough to cover the nation's entire military. This marks the first time the U.S. has offered covid vaccines to a foreign military. But the agreement fell short of South Korea's expectations on vaccine swap. How do you see this and the level of S. Korea-U.S. vaccine cooperation?\n\n Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation for us from Washington D.C. Thank you for your insights.",

He said that the outcome was better than expected and that Washington took into account Seoul's stance on pending issues. \n\n Moon said he got \"special gifts\" -- referring to Biden's announcement that the U.S. will provide full vaccinations for all 550-thousand South Korean military personnel.\nHe said this was the result of a special emphasis on the importance of the Seoul-Washington alliance -- noting that there was internal backlash in the Biden administration as all Americans have yet to be inoculated and that there are other countries in more dire need of vaccine support.\n\n Another present -- the appointment of Korean-American diplomat Sung Kim as Washington's special envoy to Pyeongyang.\nKim has led working-level talks with North Korea and helped organize the historic North Korea-U.S. summit in 2018.\nMoon said that this is Washington's message to Pyeongyang that it is ready for dialogue as Kim can talk without an interpreter.\n\n Presidents Moon and Biden had their first bilateral at the White House on Friday -- that lasted for about three hours.\nThey reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula based on dialogue and diplomacy.\nThe leaders also agreed to foster a comprehensive vaccine partnership, which includes scientific and technological cooperation -- to boost global supplies and contribute to ending the pandemic.\n Moon's business entourage -- which included officials from Samsung, LG and SK -- also unveiled a 39 billion dollar investment plan in the U.S.\n\n During his stay,... he also met with Vice President Kamala Harris and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.\nPresident Moon also attended a White House ceremony where Biden awarded the first Medal of Honor of his presidency to Korean War Veteran Ralph Puckett.\n It's the first time that a foreign leader has been present for that -- highlighting the strength of the alliance.\nKim Min-ji, Arirang News.",

Bringing you some of the most interesting news from around the globe, I'm Eum Ji-young.\nThousands of people fled as one of the world's most active and dangerous volcanoes, situated in the African country of the Congo, unleashed huge lava flows.\nThe night sky turned eerie red as Mount Nyiragongo erupted on Saturday,...and city of Goma with population of about two million people was thrown into panic.  \n\n(KISWAHILI-\ub0a8) \n\"We're panicked because we've just seen the entire city covered in light that isn't from electricity or lamps or torches. People fleeing from all the areas of the city are telling us that the volcano is erupting, and we've just seen the signs.\"\n\nThe lava flowing towards Goma stopped just a few hundred meters from the edge of the city.\nAccording to provincial authorities, at least 15 were killed while fleeing the lava and roughly 500 homes were destroyed and the figures are expected to increase. \nThe volcano last erupted in 2002 leaving at least 250 people dead and making around 120-thousand people homeless in the city.",

Tehran issued a statement saying that, if no breakthrough was reached on restoring the deal,... Iran would no longer grant the IAEA access to surveillance images of the country's nuclear sites. \n The lawmaker's remarks came on the same day that Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said nuclear talks will continue in Vienna until a final agreement is reached. \nAccording to the country's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency,...

Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) to be held in November in the UK.\nWe discuss what we can look forward to at the P4G this weekend. For this we speak with:\nDr. Kim Sang-hyup, President of Jeju Research Institute, Visiting Professor at the Graduate School of Green Growth of KAIST, and Mark Buttigieg, Economic Diplomacy Counsellor of British Embassy Seoul.\n\n\n1. Sang-hyup: What is the significance of holding the P4G meeting -- why are partnerships so important?\n\n\n2. Mark: What kind of commitments or developments are you hoping to see from the P4G meeting, in the lead up to the UN Climate Conference in Glasgow? How does P4G tie in with the UK's goals for COP26?\n\n\n3. Sang-hyup: How significant is the hosting of P4G for Korea, and what kind of examples do you expect South Korea to be sharing at P4G?\n\n\n4. Mark: The UK became the first major country to pass a net zero emissions law in 2019. How have you been strengthening partnerships with industry and academia to foster climate innovation (through Catapult centres, for instance)?\n\n5. Mark: It's challenging for most governments to get members of the public involved in climate initiatives. How has the UK government engaged civil society in green growth?\n\n\n6. Sang-hyup: Many have criticised South Korea's Green New Deal for not being ambitious enough and it seems to lack sufficient means of supporting partnerships or bottom-up initiatives for green growth. What are your thoughts and what policy initiatives would you like to see?\n\n\n7. Sang-hyup: In which areas does South Korea have the potential to lead in climate technology?\n\n8. Mark: What are some areas of technology that South Korea and the UK could cooperate in?\n\nThis is where we'll have to wrap up the interview. \nThat was Dr. Kim Sang-hyup, President of Jeju Research Institute, and Mark Buttigieg, Economic Diplomacy Counsellor of British Embassy Seoul.

Dust levels will remain bad through tomorrow in many parts of the country. \n\n We had lots of clouds to start the day but there will be more sunshine in the afternoon, while highs will be in the low to mid twenties. Seoul getting up to 24 degrees, which is similar to yesterday. Southern provinces will notice highs that are 3 to 4 degrees lower this afternoon. \n\n The Gyeongsang-do Provinces and Daegu as well as Busan will see light passing showers this afternoon. Tomorrow, though, we have 5 to 20 millimeters of rain in the forecast for central parts of the country, which should help to clear the dust from the air. \n\nIn fact, we have frequent rain in store this week along with cooler than seasonal average temperatures. \n\nThat's Korea for you and here's a look at weather conditions around the world.",

So the shots prevent fatalities by close to one hundred percent.\"\n\nHealth authorities have found that a single dose drops COVID-19's fatality rate for those aged eighty and older from 6.8 percent to zero.\nThe vaccination campaign has slowed in recent days, but the global vaccine partnership forged between South Korea and the U.S. is expected to boost the pace in the second half of the year.\nThe first batch of the Moderna vaccine, 55-thousand doses, will arrive in the country next Monday according to officials.\nSouth Korea's total number of COVID-19 cases is now slightly under 136-thousand-five-hundred.\nThe virus claimed three more lives, raising the death toll to one-thousand-934.\nHan Seong-woo, Arirang News.",

Users can record the sound of the leak through water meters or water valves. All you have to do is push the \u2018Start\u2019 button and the sound is transmitted via your smartphone, which is then analyzed in terms of its frequency. What you see here is the frequency chart. Using this system, as long as there\u2019s someone on site to record the sound, we can easily determine if and where a leak is taking place.\n\nThis company\u2019s answer to water lost to leakages,... is a simple new tool that can be used by ordinary people... rather than trained specialists.\n\nUsing a set of basic equipment,... the user listens in for the sound of leaking water,... which is then transmitted using a smartphone. The coordinates of the sound and other data are then uploaded on a server,... which are analyzed by artificial intelligence to pinpoint the exact location of the leak.\n\nThis tool could allow people in developing countries to better manage their water resources and accurately detect any leaks... with minimal training,... as long as they have access to the Internet.\n\nCHA Sang-hoon,  CEO /  WI.Plat \nIn the case of Vietnam, there are many utility operators that lose around 30-40% of their water to underground leaks. If countries like Vietnam can use our technology to reduce their leaks, they wouldn\u2019t need to build additional water purification plants. It will allow them better access to water resources, not to mention the cost savings in building, manning and operating new water plants. Unlike advanced countries, developing nations are still in need of new infrastructure to supply more water, so having the technology to prevent leakages will be very beneficial to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe world\u2019s swelling population... and rapid urbanization,... has led to more demand for water than ever before. Unless we can address the problem of leakages... by managing our water sources in a smarter and more efficient way,... the world could face a very grim future.\n\n\u2018Carbon-Neutral Smart Water Management for Climate Resilience\u2019 will be the main thematic session on the subject of water... at the 2021 P4G Summit,... serving as a platform for the sharing of smart water management policies and technologies.",

So the shots prevent fatalities by close to one hundred percent.\"\n\nHealth authorities have found that a single dose drops COVID-19's fatality rate for those aged eighty and older from 6.8 percent to zero.\nThe vaccination campaign has slowed in recent days, but the global vaccine partnership forged between South Korea and the U.S. is expected to boost the pace in the second half of the year.\nThe first batch of the Moderna vaccine, 55-thousand doses, will arrive in the country next Monday according to officials.\nSouth Korea's total number of COVID-19 cases is now slightly under 136-thousand-five-hundred.\nThe virus claimed three more lives, raising the death toll to one-thousand-934.\nHan Seong-woo, Arirang News.",

Thank you for making time today.\n\n Good afternoon.\n\n Let's start with Wall Street. Stocks in New York ended mixed on Friday, led by tech stocks but leaving a small gain on the Dow. Making more headlines the past few days, though, has been the big swings in crypto, after China announced that it's effectively banning it. What's the story in the global markets on this Monday?\n\n \n\n \n\n Korean stocks today trading a little lower, especially tech shares on the KOSDAQ.

Korea-U.S. summit: Gains and remaining tasks-- it's the topic of our news in-depth tonight, joining me in the studio is Dr. WOO Jung-Yeop (\uc6b0\uc815\uc5fd), Director of the Center for American Studies at the Sejong Institute.\nGreat to have you on our show.\n\n\n\n Doctor Woo, the two leaders agreed to form a close vaccine partnership, including vaccine manufacturing, with President Biden offering to provide South Korean troops with 555,000 doses. \nBut they fell short of discussing a vaccine swap, which was one of President Moon's top priorities. \nHow do you assess the level of Seoul-Washington vaccine cooperation?\n\n While the latest vaccine partnership is expected to give a big boost to production in Indo-Pacific region, Seoul and Washington also agreed to work closely to build a supply network of chips, batteries and medicine. \nHow do you see the scope of their alliance expanding to non-conventional fields, and how would regional players take this?\n\n Now to North Korea. The joint statement stipulates that \"dialogue based on the Panmunjeom Declaration and the 2018 Singapore agreement are essential\" to achieve denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. \nThis is what the Moon administration picks as one of the biggest gains from the summit. \nWhat does this imply, and would this give President Moon more leeway in getting the U.S. on board for his denuclearization approach?\n\n The biggest surprise from the joint statement was the appointment of Sung Kim as U.S. special envoy for North Korea. \nKim previously served as U.S. special representative for North Korea policy and also was the U.S. special envoy for the Six-Party Talks... being at the center of North Korea negotiations since the Bush administration. \nWhat does this tell us about the Biden administration's undisclosed North Korea policy?\n\n Dr. Woo, the two leaders also emphasized the importance of \"preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as well as maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and beyond\". \nDoes this mean that South Korea ended its strategic non-decision between the two superpowers? Do you think its now tilting towards the U.S.?\n\n And lastly, President Moon happily announced the abolishment of guidelines on South Korea's missile use which had been in place over the last 42 years. \nWhat significance does it hold for the South Korea-U.S. military alliance and how will Asian neighbors respond?\n\n Dr. WOO Jung-Yeop (\uc6b0\uc815\uc5fd) of the Sejong Institute for our news in-depth tonight.

        "artcl_ctt": "\"The best trip, the best summit.\"\nThat's how President Moon Jae-in summed up his four-day working visit to the U.S. for his summit with President Joe Biden.\nThey met for a total of 171 minutes at the White House -- an hour longer than scheduled, reaffirming their commitment and coordination on a wide range of issues, including North Korea, COVID-19 and the two countries' seven-decade-long alliance.\n\n For starters, the leaders discussed their common goal of achieving complete denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula,... both saying that diplomacy and dialogue based on their past agreements, is essential.\n\n(\uc790\ub9c9)\n \"We welcome the Biden administration's North Korea policy, which builds on past agreements, like the Singapore joint statement, for a calibrated and practical approach to seeking diplomacy with Pyeongyang.\"\n\uc2f1\uac00\ud3ec\ub974 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc131\uba85 \ub4f1 \uacfc\uac70 \ud569\uc758\ub97c \ud1a0\ub300\ub85c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd81\ud55c\uacfc\uc758 \uc678\uad50\ub97c \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uaca0\ub2e4\ub294 \ubc14\uc774\ub4e0 \uc815\ubd80\uc758 \ub300\ubd81 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ud658\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n Biden also made a surprise announcement,... naming as special envoy to Pyeongyang... the Korean-American diplomat Sung Kim, who has experience negotiating with the North.\nHowever, Biden ruled out the possibility of a so-called top-down approach,... like that taken by his predecessor,... and there was no specific mention of the issue of sanctions.\n\n(ENG)\n \"I would make sure that my team had met with their counterparts, and I know exactly what we're meeting on.\"\n\n The allies also agreed to foster a vaccine partnership, which includes scientific and technological cooperation -- a move that's expected to take Seoul a step closer to its goal of becoming a global vaccine production hub.\nThe U.S. will also be providing South Korea with full vaccinations for all 550-thousand of its troops -- however, that falls short of a vaccine swap, under which it  would get surplus American doses and return them at a later date.\n\n(\uc790\ub9c9)\n \"Collaboration between our two countries will boost global vaccine supply and contribute to accelerating a complete ending of COVID-19. I also thank President Biden's announcement of vaccines for Korean servicemen. I believe this is a meaningful measure that extends the special South Korea-U.S. alliance to the field of health.\n\uc591\uad6d\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc740 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0 \ubc31\uc2e0 \uacf5\uae09\uc744 \ub298\ub824 \ucf54\ub85c\ub098\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc885\uc2dd\uc744 \uc55e\ub2f9\uae30\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

South Korea's major conglomerates, including Samsung Electronics, pledged investment plans in the U.S. worth 39 billion dollars.\n\n(ENG)\n \"These new investments are going to create thousands of good-paying jobs and jobs of the future right here in the United States. And they're going to help fortify and secure the supply chains for things like semiconductors and electric batteries.\"\n\n Another achievement was the abolition of missile guidelines on South Korea -- giving it complete control over its use of missiles and paving the way for missile sovereignty.\nThose guidelines, first agreed to in 1979 in exchange for U.S. technology, banned Seoul from developing missiles with a flight range over 800 kilometers.\n\n(\uc790\ub9c9)\n It is with pleasure that I deliver news of the termination of the revised missile guidelines. Along with the signing, in the early days of the Biden administration, of the Special Measures Agreement on sharing defense costs, this is a symbolic and practical measure that displays the robustness of our alliance\n\ub610\ud55c \uae30\uc05c \ub9c8\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc0ac\uc77c \uc9c0\uce68 \uc885\ub8cc \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \uc804\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc14\uc774\ub4e0 \ud589\uc815\ubd80 \ucd9c\ubc94 \ucd08\uae30 \ud55c\ubbf8 \ubc29\uc704\ube44 \ud611\uc815 \ud0c0\uacb0\uacfc \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4 \ud55c\ubbf8\ub3d9\ub9f9\uc758 \uad73\uac74\ud568\uc744 \ub300\uc678\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacfc\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uce58\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n This in part, is seen as one of Washington's strategies to counter China.\nAnd in what could put South Korea in a sticky position -- the leaders' joint statement read that Moon and Biden emphasize the importance of preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n On the Washington-led QUAD initiative to counter Beijing's rising influence -- Moon and Biden said they acknowledge the importance of multilateralism,... reaffirming support for enhanced cooperation with countries in the Pacific.\nKim Min-ji, Arirang News.",

Ambassador Yoo is the Executive Director of the 2021 P4G Seoul Summit Preparatory Office.\n\nAmbassador Yoo, I know this is a busy week for you. Thank you for speaking with us tonight. \n\n\n\n\n As my team and I made ourselves into this eco-friendly venue prepared for breakout sessions leading up to the actual summit this weekend, we had to go through multiple layers of quarantine checks. \nThis multilateral summit was postponed once due to the pandemic last year and it had to reorganized into a virtual and a hybrid one this year. How was it like preparing for a global summit amidst a pandemic of such magnitude?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The P4G Summit in its second year in Seoul this time following the inaugural summit in Denmark has a shorter history than other Climate Change Conferences. It is hard to deny that the P4G is less well known than other environment-related multilaterals. Coming just a few months after U.S. President Joe Biden's Leaders Summit on Climate and a couple of months before the COP26 in Glasgow this November. \nWhat specific purpose would the P4G Seoul summit hold that would induce the world to tune in?\n\n One notable aspect about the P4G summit is its inclusiveness. It serves as a platform that invites not only the public sector, namely the goverments of different countries, but also businesses - we have the RE100 and many multinational have been bringing ESG to the forefront of their business initiatives - and civil societies. How do you expect South Korea to play a bridging role between these parties as well as the developed and developing economies?\n\n During their joint press conference following Presidents Moon and Biden's summit in Washington last week, the U.S. President said he welcomes South Korea's plan to release early in October its provisional enhanced 2030 target, and by COP 26 its final enhanced 2030 target aligned with efforts to limit the global average temperature increase to 1-point-5 degrees Celsius.\nI would imagine the enhanced target would be at least double the current NDC which is a 24-point-4 percent emission cut from 2017 levels. How can South Korea achieve that goal?\n\n As the executive director of the P4G Summit Preparatory Office, what would be an A plus plus Seoul Summit Declaration look like? What do you hope to see included in the 2021 P4G Seoul Summit Declaration?\n\n Of course, on the last day of the P4G Summit - the 31st of May that is - the host nation of the next P4G will be unveiled. As someone who's been working particularly hard to make this summit a success for the last three years... where do you hope to see the next summit taking place?\n\n\n\n Ambassador Yoo Yeonchul, Executive Director of the P4G Seoul Summit Preparatory Office, many thanks for your time today and best of luck to you until the concluding day.",

AND... they have REPORTEDLY... REVIEWED... HUNDREDS of... RELATED CASES.\nFor more... I have Kim Dami... here in the studio.\nWelcome... Dami.\n\n Good afternoon, Sunhee.  \n\n Dami... let's begin... with the government's review... of these post-inoculation repercussions.\n\n Sure Sunny. The latest government study has revealed... that vaccines may have led to serious side effects... in a total of 39 people.\n The country's vaccine task force said Monday... that 37 of them were suspected cases of anaphylaxis.\nIn a total of 13 meetings,... local health authorities reviewed around two-hundred-50 reported cases... of serious adverse reactions,... that have led to critical illnesses or death. \nThey included 150... with suspected links to anaphylaxis.\n In the 39 cases where a causal link to the vaccine has been identified... each patient will receive around nine-thousand U.S. dollars... to cover their hospital expenses.\nAstraZeneca vaccines were linked to the most number of cases,... followed by Pfizer.\nSide effects were more prevalent in women than men,... and also young people,... with the most number of cases being reported... among those 18-to-29 years-old.  \nVaccines were ruled out as a cause... in some cases,... with health authorities citing pre-existing health conditions.\n\n(KOREAN - \uc5ec) \uc6d4\uc694\uc77c \ube0c\ub9ac\ud551 \n \"We suspect that the likely causes of death in these cases... were sudden cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, brain hemorrhaging, pneumonia and sepsis.\"\n\nShe added... that a final evaluation is still pending for some of the cases,... as they await autopsy results.\n\n And... there has been YET ANOTHER VOTE OF CONFIDENCE... by authorities... with regard to VACCINATIONS... for the elderly?\n\n Yes. \nHealth authorities say... even one vaccine dose... is almost 90 percent effective in stopping new infections... and so far, 100 percent effective in preventing deaths... among the elderly. Take a listen.\n\n(KOREAN - \uc5ec) \uc6d4\uc694\uc77c \ube0c\ub9ac\ud551 \n \"There have been no reported deaths among vaccine recipients aged 60 and above. This represents a 100% reduction in the fatality rate as a result of vaccinations.\"\n\n Also,... the vaccines also lowered the chance of secondary infections... taking place within household settings.\nSo even if you contracted COVID-19 after being vaccinated,... you are less likely to transmit the virus to your family members.\nThis is why the government is urging the elderly to get vaccinated by late-June,... saying they'll be moved to the back of the line,... and wait until the fourth quarter if they don't get their shots now.\n\n I also... hear... vaccine supplies... are rolling... in?\n\n Right.\nOver a million additional AstraZeneca jabs were supplied earlier this morning. \n These are the ones that Korea's SK Bioscience is manufacturing... in the city of Andong,... in the southeastern part of country.\nPlus,... around five-point-six million AZ shots will be shipped out... by the first week of next month. \nKorean health authorities have secured around 20 million AZ vaccines so far. \nAdditional 55-thousand Moderna vaccines are also on the way... and will arrive here in the country next Monday. \nThis is still only a fraction... of the 192 million vaccine doses that Korea has secured. \n\n And... before you go... Dami... I believe... there is a more convenient way... to sign up... for NO SHOW VACCINES?\n\n Absolutely.\nStarting Thursday, people can easily check... if there are any 'no-show' vaccines in their vicinity... through a local portal site and digital map.\n It will show how many shots are available... which medical centers are offering them,... and allows users to book their appointments online.\nThey can make their reservations... through the KCDA website... after verifying their identity. \nThis could help the country further speed up its vaccination drive,... and to minimize the disposal of unused vaccines.  \n\nThanks for joining us today.\n\nMy pleasure.",

John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said exactly that.\nCoates on Saturday said to reporters that the Games would open even if Tokyo and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency\u2026. and that the Games would go on even if Japan\u2019s local medical experts advised against it.\nHe said that the IOC\u2019s anti-virus measures will ensure a safe and secure Olympics.\nThis after Japan's top COVID-19 advisor, Shigeru Omi, on Friday said that a decision must be made after taking into account the impact on the nation's medical system.\nMore than 80% of the Japanese public want the Olympics postponed or canceled but only the IOC has the power to do so.\n\nTo football now, the Premier League season came to a close on Sunday. Not the best of campaigns for Tottenham but it turned out to be a stellar year for Son Heung-min?\n\nYes, indeed. He recorded a new career high with 17 goals in 37 matches, his previous best was 14 in the 2016-17 season.\nThis earned Son the club\u2019s sponsor\u2019s Player of the Year Award.\nSon was one of only three Premier League players to reach double figures in goals and assists, joining teammate Harry Kane and Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes.\nMeanwhile, Son Heung-min on Monday was named in the Korean National Team squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers.\nKorea will play Turkmenistan on Saturday 5th June and Sri Lanka on Wednesday 9th June both at 8PM and then Lebanon on Sunday 13th at 3 PM.\nAll matches will be played at Goyang Stadium as a centralized hub... and were originally scheduled for March 2020 but were postponed due to the pandemic.\nThe Olympic team will play two friendlies against Ghana on Jeju Island on June 12th and June 15th.\nThe squad includes three Europe-based stars Lee Kang-in, Lee Seung-woo and Jeong Woo-young.\n\nTo baseball now, two Korean derbies in MLB in the space of a week, this time with Ryu Hyun-jin and Choi Ji-man. How did it unfold?\n\nYes, Ryu Hyun-jin went up against Choi Ji-man in MLB on Sunday local time.\nIt was their first ever meeting in the majors.\nThe Rays won 6-4 at TD Ballpark in Florida, on Sunday local time. \nBut the all-Korean pitcher-batter duel ended in Ryu Hyun-jin\u2019s favor.\nRyu got Choi to ground out in his first time up in the second inning. \nIn the sixth, Ryu struck out Choi with a fastball clocked at 91-point-6 mph, the hardest pitch he threw in the game.\nIt was Tampa\u2019s 10th straight win but fifth loss in a row for Toronto.\n\nAnd finally to golf. Phil Mickelson stunned everyone by becoming the oldest PGA Championship winner. What can you tell us?\n\nYes, that\u2019s right. 50-year-old Phil Mickelson on Sunday became the oldest winner of a major golf tournament.\nAfter a tense final round on the treacherous Ocean Course at Kiawah Island in Southern California, Mickelson shot six under par for the tournament, finishing two strokes ahead of the runners-up, Brooks Koepka and Louis Oosthuizen.\nHe hadn't won since 2019 at Pebble Beach and hadn't lifted a major championship trophy since 2013 at Muirfield. \n\nThank-you for that, Paul. We will see you again next week.\n\nThank-you.",

GLOBAL SOLIDARITY... on GREEN GROWTH.\nNOW... on the SIDELINES... of that SUMMIT... a FASHION SHOW was held... PROMOTING... WASTE REDUCTION... through... FASHION... STATEMENTS.\nFor more... I have Kim Sung-hyun (\uae40\uc131\ud604)... here... in the studio.\nSung-hyun... do walk us... through... this meaningful event.\n\n Sure, Sunny...as you said, it was promoting waste reduction... The show paid homage to one of the P4G\u2019s five main areas of collaboration... which was indeed regarding climate change,... namely the \u2018Circular Economy\u2019.\n\n The \u2018Upcycling Fashion Show\u2019 as it was called,... was organized by Korea\u2019s Ministry of the Environment,... making use of waste materials... to make bags, clothing,... as well as other fashion accessories.\n While recycling requires materials to be broken down first,... UPCYCLING... or creative re-use... turns waste directly into a new product... resulting in goods that are of higher-quality... and that are more energy efficient. \n The world has seen a dramatic increase in the use of single-use plastics... amid the COVID-19 pandemic,... and upcycling is being looked to as one solution... that could help us tackle the growing problem of plastic pollution.\n There were a number of dignitaries on hand,... including Korea\u2019s First Lady,... the wives of foreign ambassadors,... as well as business representatives and environmental activists among others. However,... attendance was limited to 100 people,... and most certainly, masking and social distancing rules were in effect... in light of the risks posed by COVID-19. \n Nevertheless,... there was no shortage of spectacles at the event,... featuring many top models and a music performance... by a folk fusion band named (\uc774\ub0a0\uce58)Leenalchi.\n\n I understand... the First Lady caught the eyes... of many... there... with her rather unique outfit?\n\n That\u2019s right...she was seen wearing a beautiful and special hanbok, Sunny...\n First Lady Kim Jung-sook wore a traditional hanbok,... and so did the wives of many foreign dignitaries... who were also at the event. \nNot only did they look stunning,... but their outfits also had eco-friendliness in mind,... being made out of upcycled materials... sourced from plastic waste. But,... you couldn\u2019t tell just by looking at them,... because they were just so natural....\n Moreover, the attendees wore face masks...which were specially-designed to match their hanboks,... also made from upcycled materials. This made it possible to successfully convey the value of resource recycling... together with Korean traditional beauty.\n\n And... the show... itself... was held... against... the stunning backdrop... of Gyeongbokgung Palace?\n\n That's right... I think \uacbd\ubcf5\uad81 Palace looked even more beautiful on Monday night...  \n More specifically,... the event was held at (\uacbd\ud68c\ub8e8)Gyeonghoelu, a pavilion inside Gyeongbokgung Palace,... where kings of the Chosun Dynasty used to hold large banquets centuries ago. \n The theme of the fashion show... was that of a sustainable future... through the upcycling of waste,... exploring elements from both the past and the present. Many clothing and other fashion items were on display,... including shoes, bags, casual wear, sportswear and hanbok. The show also featured some of Korea\u2019s most iconic supermodels,... including (\uc1a1\uacbd\uc544)Song Kyung-ah and (\ud55c\ud604\ubbfc)Han Hyun-min.\n\n Tell us... a bit... about the BUZZ... over... some of the items... on display?\n\n Yes...The show was divided into three parts, Sunny... It was showcasing in Part 1. casual everyday wear, Part 2. sportswear, and Part 3. hanbok...exactly in that order. \n\n Supermodel Song Kyung-ah(\uc1a1\uacbd\uc544) was the first to hit the runway,... wearing a black jacket and long skirt. All in all...the runway models were wearing casual everyday outfits, including a shirt, jacket, or just a pair of jeans that didn\u2019t look out of the ordinary... at first glance. BUT,... they were all made from materials... sourced from plastic waste... and scraps of fabric that had been disposed of...which is the reason why it made them special.\n Part two of the event... showcased athletic wear and clothing for workouts... made from plastic waste. These already have a large presence... in the apparel market... and they come with eco-friendly certifications... depending on the amount of waste plastic that is used to make each of the items.\n Fusion hanboks were featured in Part Three of the show,...which were made from leftover fabric... that still had a particular signage on it...of a well-known food company for instance...as well as from canvas banners...that had been re-processed... but still retaining their original colors and patterns.\n Korean actress Park Jin-hee(\ubc15\uc9c4\ud76c) and rapper Sean... graced the final stage... each wearing a Hanbok. Park Jin-hee\u2019s dark brown hanbok in particular.. was made... using a combination of waste plastic... and burlap bags... that were once used to store coffee beans,... which captured the imagination of the audience. This sort of transformation of waste... was not only surprising but beautiful...and the audience seemed to watch with admiration.\n\n So... what SHIFTS... in TRENDS... are we... expecting... in the fashion industry... moving forward?\n\n As mentioned earlier, Sunny... COVID-19 has triggered an immense surge in waste pollution,...In fact...the world is throwing away 15% more plastic compared to pre-pandemic levels. The circular economy is an essential driver... in our path towards a greener future,... \n\n and organizers of this fashion show,... are hoping to raise public awareness on the importance of upcycling... through events like these. Many players in the fashion industry are supportive of this transition,... and the presence of many top fashion brands as well as models at this event... is evidence of that. So,.. we are expecting a growing number of upcycled products... not only in fashion,... but also other industries,... and this is one of the main goals that the P4G partners had underscored... during their summit here in Seoul.\n\n All right... Sung-hyun... thank you... for that coverage.",

This morning we had a wet AND yellow start as the showers were mixed with high levels of yellow dust. Rain is letting up and the air quality should improve by the afternoon. \n\n So we can expect much nicer weather by the afternoon. But temperatures will only get up to 19 degrees Celsius in Seoul that's about 5 degrees lower than yesterday. Southern provinces will have warmth topping out in the mid twenties, while the west coast will be buffered by strong winds. \n\n There's another band of rain in the forecast at the end of the week so, keep an umbrella handy!  But we should have pleasant weather by the weekend.  \n\nThat's Korea for you and here's a look at weather conditions around the world.",

Through the P4G summit, we hope to provide a path for energy companies to spur innovation and achieve sustainable growth, and hold in-depth discussions to foster global cooperation on green, inclusive growth.\n\nAfrica accounts for only a negligible proportion... of the world\u2019s total carbon emissions,... yet the continent has borne the brunt of the impact of climate change. Today,... it is estimated that 1 in 5 children in Africa,... are taking part in child labor instead of going to school.\n\nIn Kenya,... located in the Horn of Africa,... a Korean firm has rolled out an innovative idea... to help the country address its challenges in both education and energy... through a single solution.\n\nThis is \u2018Solar Cow\u2019... a solar charging station.\n\nSolar Cow: A solar charging system for portable batteries\n\nThey are placed near schools,... and the station charges portable batteries that students can take back to power their homes,... incentivizing children to stay in school.\n\nThe burning sun in Africa is an endless source of abundant energy,... and this solution not only seeks to address Kenya\u2019s power shortages,... but also to present a brighter future for the country\u2019s youth ... through the power of education.\n\nCHANG Sung-un, CEO /  YOLK \t\nEven if they built new power plants, it is still difficult for people in remote areas to have access to electricity. Also, what good is it to build new schools if we can\u2019t get children to come? We put a lot of thought into this issue, which led to the creation of \u2018Solar Cow\u2019.\n\nChildren could end up skipping school,... if they\u2019re given too much electricity in one go,... so the batteries are charged with just enough power to last for one day,... to encourage them to come to school every day.\n\nOne \u2018Solar Cow\u2019 is only enough to provide electricity for a small village,... but it\u2019s been hailed as an innovative and scalable new method... of broadening the access to energy in remote areas.\n\nCHANG Sung-un, CEO /  YOLK \t\nIt can charge 124 batteries simultaneously. It takes half-a-day to charge one battery, so that comes to 250 batteries a day when you charge one batch in the morning, and another in the evening. It is enough to provide electricity to a whole village.\n\nIn addition to Kenya,... the \u2018Solar Cow\u2019 project has also been launched... in neighboring Tanzania as well.\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has made travel between Korea and Tanzania difficult,... the company is providing all the necessary support,... to ensure that their solution is being put to maximum use.\n\nCHANG Sung-un, CEO /  YOLK \t\nWe hope our \u2018Solar Cow\u2019 project will allow more children to be in school, instead of being enlisted in child labor. School is not only for learning, but also a place where they can create a bond with their teachers and peers. I hope the children of Africa will have the opportunity to experience all of those things while they\u2019re still growing up.\n\nThis simple but innovative idea has sparked a revolution in the energy sector,... and not only is it helping to fight climate change,... but also allowing the children in Africa to dream of a better future... for themselves and their families.",

In Korea, the natural habitat of the Korean fir tree on Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain is drying up due to climate change.\"\n\nThe Minister of Environment explained how far South Korea has to go to reach carbon neutrality.\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec)\n\"South Korea emitted 730 million tons of carbon in 2018. We have to decrease emissions by 24 million tons every year for 30 years. That's like decreasing it by about 15 million cars.\"\n\nThe minister says carbon neutrality cannot be reached without the help of local governments.\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec)\n\"A big change is not possible without the help of local governments. They are in charge of reducing carbon in transportation, buildings, and aspects close to our day-to-day life.\"\n\nSo on Monday, during the P4G summit, more than 240 local governments signed off their will to participate, and they had time to discuss how their local regions will strive to achieve this goal.\nFrom cutting down on coal to building electric-powered transportation, South Korea's local governments on Monday promised changes for a brighter future.\nKim Yeon-seung, Arirang News",

All have won recognition overseas, thanks to the sophisticated work of the unseen men and women who translated these books.\u201d\n\nThe Literature Translation Institute of Korea has been working to get quality Korean literature translated and published worldwide. \nJust ten years ago,... the institute struggled to find the publishers abroad... but the persistent efforts paid off, leading to a virtuous cycle of Korean books winning awards and more overseas publishers to reach out to the institute. \n\n(KOREAN/\uc5ec)\n\"For the past decade, publishers abroad got to know our institute and they no longer passively publish Korean literature -- rather ask our support to publish Korean books in their own country. \nI think what we have done for over 20 years including training translators and interactions abroad is now showing results.\"\n\nShe adds that the increase in the number of native translators has also contributed to such progress. \nMore native translators are getting interested in Korean literature thanks to the broadening impact of the Korean wave,... and one of the teachers at LTI Korea's translation academy says education offered to support native translators has also been one of the reasons why the number has gone up. \n\n(ENGLISH/\uc5ec) \uc804\ud654\uc778\ud130\ubdf0\n\"Universities are doing a great job opening Korean studies departments and also presence of Korean literature and culture in Korean book fairs and international events have had great influence.\"\n\nCelebrating the 25th Anniversary of the establishment of the Literature Translation Institute of Korea,... the special exhibition \u201cYeok\" shares the history of how the institute has supported translators and helped global readers get to know more about Korean literature.\nKim Bo-kyoung, Arirang News.",

Thank you for making time today.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Let's start with the cryptocurrency space, which has of course seen extreme volatility in the last week. A few things to think about -- Fed Governor Lael Brainard again saying the U.S. needs to go for a digital dollar. She also spoke about inflation, saying that the current spike in prices is likely to be temporary. Tell us about her remarks and what you see happening in the markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n Not only crypto, but also stocks on Wall Street saw a bounce back overnight, the gain on the Nasdaq bigger as was its recent losses. The Nasdaq up about 1-point-4 percent and the S&P about 1 percent. What's behind that move in the U.S. market?\n\n\n\n\n\n Today, Korean stocks had gains similar to those in the U.S. The KOSPI back above 31-50, and the KOSDAQ at about 960. Looks like retail investors maybe taking some profits. Tell us about the Korean market.\n\n\n\n\n\n As we might expect now, data for May are showing a rebound in consumer confidence. People are feeling better about the economy overall. Tell us a bit about these numbers and what you make of them.",

In Korea, the natural habitat of the Korean fir tree on Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain is drying up due to climate change.\"\n\nThe Minister of Environment explained how far South Korea has to go to reach carbon neutrality.\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec)\n\"South Korea emitted 730 million tons of carbon in 2018. We have to decrease emissions by 24 million tons every year for 30 years. That's like decreasing it by about 15 million cars.\"\n\nThe minister says carbon neutrality cannot be reached without the help of local governments.\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec)\n\"A big change is not possible without the help of local governments. They are in charge of reducing carbon in transportation, buildings, and aspects close to our day-to-day life.\"\n\nSo on Monday, more than 240 local governments signed off their will to participate, and they had time to discuss how their local regions will strive to achieve this goal.\n\n(Standup ed: Steve)\n\"Due to Covid-19, many local government leaders had to join the forum remotely.\nBut from cutting down on coal to building electric-powered transport, there was no shortage of ideas on how to create a more eco-friendly future.\nKim Yeon-seung, Arirang News\"",

In Korea, the natural habitat of the Korean fir tree on Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain is drying up due to climate change.\"\n\nThe Minister of Environment explained how far South Korea has to go to reach carbon neutrality.\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec)\n\"South Korea emitted 730 million tons of carbon in 2018. We have to decrease emissions by 24 million tons every year for 30 years. That's like decreasing it by about 15 million cars.\"\n\nThe minister says carbon neutrality cannot be reached without the help of local governments.\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec)\n\"A big change is not possible without the help of local governments. They are in charge of reducing carbon in transportation, buildings, and aspects close to our day-to-day life.\"\n\nSo on Monday, more than 240 local governments signed off their will to participate, and they had time to discuss how their local regions will strive to achieve this goal.\n\n(Standup ed: Steve)\n\"Due to Covid-19, many local government leaders had to join the forum remotely.\nBut from cutting down on coal to building electric-powered transport, there was no shortage of ideas on how to create a more eco-friendly future.\nKim Yeon-seung, Arirang News\"",

Korea-U.S. vaccine partnership and its impact on the nation's vaccination program, Dr. Alice Tan, Internist at MizMedi Women's Hospital joins us live from Seattle.\nIt's always great to have you with us.\n\n (Seattle, Skype) \n\n Samsung Biologics signed a production deal with Moderna that would enable the Korean pharmaceutical firm to locally manufacture covid vaccines. And authorities said they will negotiate with their U.S. counterparts on the use of locally produced Moderna vaccines in Korea. Would the local production speed up vaccinations here in the country?\n\n Samsung Biologics is expected to begin pumping out millions of Moderna vaccines from the third quarter and hopes are high that it would further raise global competitiveness of the local firm. But some point out that this is not a 'Drug Substance' deal but a 'Drug Production' deal, meaning Samsung bio will be doing a low-hurdle job of bottling vaccine fluid received from Moderna. What do you say to this?\nWhat does this cooperation mean ifor South Korea's vaccine development, production capability in the long-run?\n\n South Korea and the U.S., during their leaders' bilat this past weekend agreed to launch a senior-level experts group dubbed the KORUS Global Vaccine Partnership Experts Group, to implement the partnership, comprised of scientists, experts and officials from our governments. Today, Seoul announced that the experts' group will begin operations as early as early June. What will be the role of this experts' group and how will this group be helpful in not only ending this pandemic but in preparing for future infectious diseases?\n\n Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum virtually attended the Global Health Summit co-hosted by the European Commission and Italy last week... where he suggested building a 'global hub of vaccine production' for mass vaccine supply and fair distribution to all countries. What do you think are the biggest obstacles in achieving that, and what role can South Korea play?\n\n Dr. Alice Tan, Internist at MizMedi Women's Hospital joining us live from Seattle. Many thanks as always for your insights and expertise.",

        "artcl_ctt": "A historic day for the South Korea, U.S. alliance is how many observers assessed the South Korea, U.S. Summit and the following joint news conference by Presidents Moon and Biden last week. \nNow, having carefully read through the South Korea, U.S. Joint Statement document, experts still agree that it put the alliance on the right track and provides an excellent blueprint for the future of the alliance.\nBut, remember, it's not what it appears to be on the surface. There are many more parties involved in this agreement than the two allies.\n\nLet's try to decipher the statement. We have Evans Revere, Senior Advisor at Albright Stonebridge Group joining us live this evening. \nMr. Evans Revere was previously the principal Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\n\nMr. Evans Revere, as always, it's wonderful to have you on the show.\n\n(New Jersey)  \n\n\n\n\n\n I want to start with North Korea. In the joint statement, it reads the two leaders agree \"dialogue based on the Panmunjom Declaration and the 2018 Singapore agreement are essential\" to achieve denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\nHowever, when asked what conditions North Korean leader Kim Jong-un would have to meet in order for President Biden to meet Kim, Biden said he would not do anything that would grant the North Korean leader international recognition unless he knows for sure through working level talks that Kim is serious about commitments regarding nuclear arsenal. How big of a value is this concept of continuity vis-a-vis North Korea important to the Biden administration?\n\n If we put recent pieces together, the Biden administration's North Korea policy would take a \"pragmatic approach\" with \"maximum flexibility\" that's based on agreements made in 2018, with long-time North Korea negotiator, Sung Kim being the new U.S. pointman. While it is good news and may send a positive message to Pyeongyang, Sung Kim is still the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia. I wonder how effective it will be in appointing a pointman on North Korea at this point and despite all these adjectives describing the Biden administration's North Korea policy review and direction from here on forth, it still lacks specific details. Help us get a better grasp of Biden's North Korea policy.\n\n An explicit mention of promoting North Korean human rights in the joint statement. Were you taken back by that at all? How do you expect North Korea to respond to the summit outcome?\n\n For the first time, a Seoul-Washington joint summit statement included reference to the Taiwan Strait which prompted China's warning that it \"won't tolerate infringement on sovereign matters by outside forces\". Moon and Biden also reaffirmed the importance of transparent regional multilateralism, including the Quad. Do you interpret this as South Korea tilting towards the U.S. in Sino-U.S. hegemony war, and how would this impact future Seoul-Beijing relations?\n\n The two leaders agreed to form close vaccine partnership, including vaccine manufacturing, with President Biden offering to provide South Korean troops with 555,000 doses. But they fell short of discussing vaccine swap, which was one of President Moon's top priorities. How do you assess the level of Seoul-Washington vaccine cooperation? \n\n Evans Revere live from the U.S. for us. Thank you.",

What significance does this hold for both countries from economic standpoint?\n\n In a recently published contribution, you've mentioned that it's important for the Moon administration to collaborate with the Biden administration to take a different approach to post-pandemic economic recovery. Could you give us some ideal scenarios?\n\n South Korean tech giants' vital role as an investor and strategic partner for the U.S. was evident during the summit with top 4 Korean conglomerates announcing investment worth over 39 billion dollars in U.S. chip and battery industries. How significant is this for the U.S. economy and also for S. Korea-U.S. economic relations going forward?\n\n AMCHAM has launched a committee to oversee environmental, social and governance, or ESG goals. Give us a brief introduction, and what specific ESG initiatives are being made by U.S. firms in Korea led by AMCHAM?\n\n The very first U.S.-Korea ESG Forum was held earlier this month. How do you assess Korea companies' efforts towards ESG goals thus far, and how can American firms help in materializing those goals?\n\n James Kim, chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce joining us for our news in-depth tonight.

Slavitt appealed to Americans who remain on the fence about getting vaccinated to get the shots.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,... as of 6PM Monday,... 61-point-5 percent of American adults had received at least one shot,... while 49-point-8 percent were fully vaccinated.\nOverall,... 49-point-4 percent of the U.S. population age 12 and above have received at least one shot,... while 39-point-3 percent is fully vaccinated.\nPresident Biden said earlier this month,... that he wanted 160 million American adults to be fully vaccinated by July 4th.\n With more and more Americans vaccinated,... experts believe airline travel in the country will rebound quickly.\nRecent demand for leisure trips have brought ticket yields to 90-percent of 2019 levels,... with expectations that autumn figures could hit or even exceed 2019 levels.\n In Europe,... EU leaders on Tuesday agreed to donate at least 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries by the end of the year.\nGathering in Brussels for a two-day summit,... the leaders pledged to continue efforts \"to increase global vaccine production capacities in order to meet global needs.\u201d\nThe agreement comes as the EU is now seeing a steady rise in supplies.\nLee Seung-jae, Arirang News.",

Gatherings and activities at senior centers and community centers will be held much more freely.\"\n1\ud68c \uc811\uc885\uc744 \ub9c8\uce58\uc2e0 \ubd84\uc740 \uc9c1\uacc4\uac00\uc871\ubaa8\uc784 \uc778\uc6d0\uc81c\ud55c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc678\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ub85c\ub2f9\uacfc \ubcf5\uc9c0\uad00\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\uc784\uacfc \ud65c\ub3d9\ub3c4 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc790\uc720\ub86d\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nThe so-called vaccine incentives come as the government is encouraging people to get the jabs to speed up the country's inoculation process. \nPLUS, starting July 1st, people who have gotten even just one vaccine dose will not be required to wear masks in some outdoor areas like parks and trails.\nThey will also be exempt from restrictions on the number of attendees at some facilities as well as at religious activities. \nAnd those who have received two shots will be exempt from attendance limits at private meetings, restaurants, cafes and weddings. \nThe Prime Minister said all these incentives will be reevaluated after the end of September when over 70 percent of the population is expected to have completed the first dose of vaccination. \nThat's when the need to wear masks indoors could be reconsidered.\n\n \nAs of now, seven-point-five percent of the population have received their first dose of the vaccine. \nBut the country's inoculation program will start to pick up from Thursday. \nWho is eligible?\n\n So the first dose of vaccinations will begin for those aged between 65 and 74 as well as those with critical respiratory symptoms. \nNow, with the broader range of vaccine eligibility and more vaccine shots secured, the government is confident it can inoculate over a million people a day. \nSo starting Thursday, over five-point-one million people will be able to get their jabs at almost 13-thousand designated medical centers across the country.  \nOn top of over three million doses of AZ shots secured in the country, an additional five-point-five million doses will be ready by the first week of next month. \nNow, with cluster infections continuing to pop up across the country, South Korea has added seven-hundred seven new COVID-19 cases earlier this morning.\nThat's all I have for now.

Korea, U.S. joint statement, there was an explicit mention of North Korea's human rights but Presidents Moon and Biden didn't go too far in provoking the North. Instead, they made clear denuclearization efforts will build on the Panmunjeom Declaration and 2018 Singapore agreement. Now the ball is in North Korea's court. Do we expect North Korea to react? \n\n North Korea experts remain divided on the importance of having the Panmunjeom Declaration and the Singapore Agreement included in the joint statement.\nSome say it's a gamechanger in getting North Korea reengaged in dialogue while others don't place much meaning. Like everything else in life, you need to build on your past to move forward whether the past has been a success or a failure. Do you think there could be a gap in the way this is interpreted between Seoul and Washington?\n\n South Korea's national intelligence chief Park Jie-won flew to the U.S. to follow up on the leaders' summit last week. We're also hearing that the U.S. has already reached out to North Korea for talks. His first stop is apparently New York and then Washington. Does this mean that the New York channel is open and will North Korea accept the invitation for dialogue?\n\n(SKYPE)\n As re-engagement with North Korea was one of South Korean President Moon Jae-in's top priorities during the summit last week, U.S. President Joe Biden had his own priorities. Strengthening South Korea, U.S. bilateral alliance, yes, but, observers say also pulling South Korea further in alignment with the U.S.' broader strategy for the Indo-Pacific region.\nFor some more perspective, we are joined by Patrick Cronin, Asia-Pacific Security Chair at Hudson Institute.\nPatrick Cronin, great to have you with us.\n\n(Washington, D.C.) \n\n\n Now that we've had the time to digest the joint statement and read between the lines, what does the summit signal about the U.S. approach to South Korea in dealing with China?\n\n For the first time, a Seoul-Washington joint summit statement included reference to the Taiwan Strait which prompted China's warning that it \"won't tolerate infringement on sovereign matters by outside forces.\" Do we expect Beijng to make any further moves vis-a-vis Seoul?\n\n Moon and Biden also reaffirmed the importance of transparent regional multilateralism, including the Quad. As the U.S. makes clear that Seoul's strategic ambiguity between Washington and Beijing will no longer be a choice, what would be the wisest steps for South Korea to make from here on forth?\n\nPatrick Cronin of Hudson Institute, many thanks for speaking with us this evening. We appreciate it.\n\n(END SKYPE)\n\n(STUDIO)\n\n Meanwhile, Dr. Go, North Korea is likely to be one of the agenda items during U.S.-Russia summit set for next month. What can we expect from the summit?\n\n Dr. Go, thank you as always.",

First off,... vaccinated people,... will be exempt from restrictions on the number of people that can gather for private gatherings,... which currently is set at under five,... and eight,... in the case of gatherings of immediate family members.

Along with that,... the revision of the social distancing system for the entire public is slated for the month of July too. \n That scheme is expected to go under another revision once 70 percent of the population has been vaccinated. Discussions will also be made on a possible easing of mask wearing rules in indoor facilities. \n\n Let's move over to international news,...

RE-AFFIRMED... their COMMITMENT... to GLOBAL WELL-BEING.\nFOR... DETAILS... on... WHAT... was... SHARED... I have JEE ABBEY LEE... here in the studio... with me.\nGood to see you again.\n\nJEE: Hi Sun-hee.\nPresident MOON Jae-in visited the American capital last Wednesday through Saturday,\u2026 making it HIS FIRST official state visit since the pandemic. \n It was also President BIDEN\u2019s second summit with a foreign leader since taking office. In today\u2019s segment,... we'll go over the key agreements from that meeting,... in regards to vaccine collaboration. To start things off,... let\u2019s hear from Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister CHUNG Eui-yong. \n\n \u201cFor our visit to the US,... we have chosen the joint communique and summary documents of our partnership... as the summit statement,... a milestone that re-visits the 70-year-long Korea-U.S. alliance serves as a guidepost for its future.\"\n\n That was Minister CHUNG speaking at a joint press conference... along with the ministers of trade and health. \nOn a broader note,... Presidents MOON and BIDEN reaffirmed their shared goal... of maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula... and tackling other global challenges... like climate change. \n\n During the summit,... President Biden said the U.S. would provide vaccines... for more than half-a-million South Korean service members,... who cross-train with American forces on a regular basis. The decision was well-received... by Seoul and local media alike.\n\n \u201cThis decision reflects their gratitude... for the emergency medical supplies we provided them in the early days of the pandemic... and also symbolizes the unique spirit of the Korea-U.S. alliance.\"\n\n I see... and... I understand... the two countries are LOOKING BEYOND... BILATERAL NEEDS... AND... to THOSE... of the GLOBE... with regard to... VACCINE COLLABORATION?\n\nJEE: That\u2019s right. So we're already seeing tangible results from the new vaccine partnership.\n [ONE-SHOT] Not only that, the countries will revise the 2003 M-O-U... on Korea-U.S. healthcare cooperation\u2026 and will also launch a joint working committee... on their global vaccine partnership.\n[\ud1b5CG] The group will consist of scientists, industry experts and government officials from both sides. They will not only work toward ending the pandemic as soon as possible,... but also prepare for the next global healthcare threat.\nLet\u2019s hear from the health minister at Tuesday\u2019s briefing\u2026 on the importance of the partnership.\n\n \u201cThe creation of the Korea-U.S. Vaccine Partnership shows\u2026 that the two countries are not only allies in the realm of security,... but also companions in the struggle against a global health crisis.\"\n\n The Korean government views the endeavor as an ideal match,... combining America's technological prowess in the biotech sector,... with Korea\u2019s pharmaceutical production capacity that's ranked second in the world,... only behind the U.S. \n\n I believe... the private sector will also be deeply involved... in the vaccine partnership?\n\nJEE: That's correct. Under the Global Vaccine Partnership, the two countries have struck four agreements,...  either in the form of MOUs or business contracts. \n [\ud1b5CG] Samsung Biologics signed a contract manufacturing agreement with Moderna\u2026 to produce m-R-N-A vaccines. In the Q-and-A session of the briefing, health minister Kwon emphasised... these will be the first m-R-N-A vaccines ever produced in Korea. He was challenged... the agreement is NOT a full technology transfer,... but a mere final step in the vaccine production. This is what Kwon had to say in response. \n\n \u201cThe final manufacturing process of vaccines... not only involves packaging and sealing,... but also cutting-edge technology in sanitation and quality control. This requires technology transfer and cooperation from original vaccine developer... to meet the highest of quality standards.\"\n\n[STUDIO 2-SHOT] Seoul also signed an MOU with Moderna to facilitate the company\u2019s investment in Korea. Minister Kwon concluded... the summit also laid the foundation for Korea to become a global vaccine production hub.\nThat\u2019s all from me today.",

We're building eco-friendly buildings and designing the city around pedestrians so that we can reduce carbon emitted by cars. Our city is leading carbon neutrality and our officials are building a sustainable city.\"\n\nAlso seated at the event were leaders of a youth activist group. \nTheir generation has more at stake if the climate crisis escalates.\n\n(Korean-\uc5ec)\n \"I think we can reach carbon neutrality if many organizations, local governments and businesses continue to work together and there continues to be events like this where they can come together to talk.\"\n\nFormer UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon highlighted how the challenge is too big for any one group to solve alone.\n\n(English-\ub0a8)\n \"The climate crisis is too big for us just one sector of society, or one industry, or one region, or even one age group.... We must work together, we must all work together.\"\n\nDuring his keynote speech, he also urged South Korea to be more ambitious when it comes to climate action.\nKim Yeon-seung, Arirang News",

Farming activity itself... also generates a significant amount of carbon emissions,... and has been a source of major environmental concern.\n\nClimate change is destroying our farms\n\n#LEE Sang-man, Director General / International Cooperation Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs\nWe have to develop new technologies in agriculture that allow farming with less energy, fertilizers and pesticides, while either maintaining the same yields or boosting them. But, developing countries are facing many challenges in this regard due to their limitations in technology and infrastructure. Therefore, advanced nations must do their part by helping them in the form of ODA among others.\n\nDuring this workshop held in Seoul in early May...\n\nP4G Partnership Workshop for Ethiopia\nMay 3, 2021 \n\nOfficials from Korea and Ethiopia gathered... to discuss a joint project... as part of the wider P4G framework. \n  \nKorea\u2019s effort... to help restore Ethiopia\u2019s dying forests... has been selected as a P4G partner initiative,... and officials from the two countries met here today... to draw up an outline... and set tangible goals for the project.\n\n#AHN Byung-gi, Director / International Cooperation Division, Korea Forest Service\n\nThe southern part of Ethiopia is the country\u2019s agricultural heartland, especially in coffee, which is now under threat as the region has become progressively drier. Creating a public-private partnership arrangement to find a solution to the crisis is the primary objective of our Ethiopia project.\n\nThe project is a multi-lateral and multi-stakeholder effort,... involving the Korea Forest Service, the Global Green Growth Inititave,... Ethiopia\u2019s Environment and Coffee Forest Forum,... and also Korean firms... representing both the conglomerate and startup sectors.\n\nThis initiative is further proof... of the crucial role being played by the P4G framework,... in facilitating public-private partnerships... to achieve our common goals in climate action.\n\nGGGI (The Global Green Growth Institute) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nECFF (Environment and Coffee Forest Forum)\n\n#KIM Hyung-soo, CEO / Tree Planet \nThrough the P4G initiative, we\u2019ve planted trees and built new processing plants, in order boost crop yields and ensure better quality as well. Through these efforts, these farms are now reporting more than double their previous revenues, and more than twice their yields as well. \n\n#Dr. Tadesse Woldemariam GOLE, Executive Director / Environment and Coffee Forest Forum\n\nThe project also aims to promote peace and stability in the region,... addressing the growing tribal conflicts in Ethiopia\u2019s coffee-growing southern regions,... which has worsened as coffee farmers fight for their survival... amid the fallout of climate change. \n \nTribal conflict further threatening Ethiopia\u2019s coffee industry\n\nThe initiative... not only seeks to protect Ethiopia\u2019s coffee industry,... but also to promtoe mutual trust and collaboration... between the different tribal groups who all depend on coffee to maintain their livelihoods.\n\nIt will not be an easy road,... but the initiative has been praised nonetheless... for promoting the value of peace first and foremost,... alongside economic gains.\n\nPeace and stability top the project\u2019s agenda\n\n#Demedo DALLE, Ethiopian Representative / GGGI \n\nResilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems,... helping local farmers to withstand the effects of climate change,... will be the headline discussion on the theme of agriculture... at the P4G Summit.\n\nResilient and sustainable agriculture\n\nFood is the most basic of human needs,... but changes are a must... in what we put on our dinner tables,... to preserve the environment and tackle the issue of climate change.\n\n#LEE Sang-man, Director General / International Cooperation Bureau, \nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs \nWe must ensure food security by boosting yields while achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the agriculture industry at the same time, and we will be discussing these two challenges during the upcoming session.",

The on-screen meeting of some 40 heads of state, along with leaders of key industries and civil society indicates just how much the world has changed since the P4G Copenhagen Summit 2018. Amid a sea of change spurring adaption, innovation, and renewed commitments, we spotlight Denmark and South Korea\u2019s efforts for green growth that can be shared globally in the spirit of partnership. We connect with Tomas Anker Christensen, Climate Ambassador of Denmark who joins us from Copenhagen.\n\n1. The last P4G conference was held in Copenhagen, known as a leading city of innovation in Europe. What makes P4G unique from other multilateral initiatives, and how has P4G supported innovative solutions for sustainable development since the summit in 2018? \n\n\n2. What are the unique dynamics of this upcoming Seoul summit? What kind of examples or commitments do you expect South Korea to contribute as the host country?\n\n\n3. Denmark is already known for having a strong ecosystem and for being one of the best places in the world to do business. What kind of social infrastructure or institutions have supported this bottom-up synergy and collaboration between different actors to nurture green growth and innovation in the country?\n\n\n4. Your government has also been promoting cross-border collaborations in social innovation. You have an Innovation Centre at your Embassy in Seoul. Could you tell us more about the work you do and some of the ventures you have supported?\n\n5. Education is also for citizens and students, especially in countries that still rely on carbon-heavy industries. Korean students have been involved in Denmark\u2019s Skylab. Do you have any advice on how to encourage entrepreneurial and sustainability-oriented mindsets?\n\n\n6. You have noted that Korea has great potential to follow in the steps of Denmark to becoming \u201cAsia\u2019s green energy export hub.\u201d In what areas and sectors do you think Korea holds the greatest potential? Is there also room for stronger collaboration with Denmark?\n\n\n7. Of course, to start a business and forge partnerships, money does matter. Particularly during these challenging pandemic times, how should financing change so that entrepreneurs and collaborations can be supported, especially in developing countries?\n\nThat was Tomas Anker Christensen, Climate Ambassador of Denmark. Thank you so much for your time.\n(Copenhagen)",

The last P4G summit was hosted by Denmark in the city of Copenhagen, which is known for its innovative ventures to go green. What you think South Korea brings to the table, as the host nation of this year's summit?  \n\n2. In the last few years, the turn towards a concerted effort towards sustainability in both public and private sectors has seen strides made,... despite major challenges along the way. For one, South Korea joined the list of 38 nations who have officially declared a 'climate emergency'. What do you think is South Korea's place in the efforts to address climate change on an inter-governmental level?  \n\n3. Countries around the world are pursuing a \"green recovery\" from the COVID-19 pandemic, and South Korea is expected to explain its own Green New Deal at the P4G summit. Do any aspects of the Green New Deal stand out to you?  \n\n4. Partnership is a critical aspect of P4G\u2019s ambitious mission; to create new relationships and to advance existing ones must be no easy task. What are the current challenges to coordinating across the interests of stakeholders, and what makes for a successful partnership that can withstand these challenges?\n\n5. P4G\u2019s theme is to make sustainability inclusive, and this is going to require a great amount of low carbon energy that is also affordable. For years you've been working to make sustainable energy accessible. In communities where there is a need for development, what measures are critical to ensure energy can be provided reliably and equitably? \n\n6. It's all well and good talking about partnerships and sustainable growth, but how do you get investors and businesses on board and convince them to go green, and that it will be profitable? \n\n7. The goals of P4G are long-term commitments for a greener future. On the other hand, fluctuations in political willingness or national capabilities are difficult to avoid, as countries naturally undergo changes such as changes in leadership. What needs to be done to make sure that the international commitment to sustainability remains stable? \n\nThat was Robyn McGuckin, Director of Partnerships for P4G.\nThank you for your time.\n(Washington, D.C.)",

Private and public partnerships were highlighted during the summit as world leaders, business heads and entrepreneurs gathered together to discuss the green way forward for the globe. As the global community moves forward, we take a look at how two companies have been putting partnerships into practice to achieve sustainability in both urban and rural settings.\nI'm joined by Kim Fredenslund, CEO of CLEAN, an environmental cluster in Denmark that connects researchers, industry and public authorities to support clean and green business ventures.\nWe also have Park Jihyeon, Managing Director of JHSUSTAIN, an international development consulting agency based in Seoul, specializing in water and climate change.\n\n\n1. Kim: The last P4G conference was held in Copenhagen, which has been a shining example of how even modernised cities are pursuing sustainable solutions to urban challenges. What are the biggest sustainability issues that modern cities face, as they attempt to go green? What kind of systems need changing?\n\n2. Jihyun: Sustainability is now a key factor in development, and you have been striving to achieve this in the Asia Pacific region. Why are partnerships between different actors crucial to helping communities achieve inclusive and sustainable growth, compared to the government-centered foreign aid model that we've seen in the past? \n\n3. Kim: Your company enables this bottom-up approach, bringing different actors together to make collaborations happen, with your \"triple helix approach\". What efforts have Copenhagen been making to turn it into a clean net-zero city, and what has been your role in this? \n\n4. Jihyun: Please tell us more about your company. How have you been driving partnerships, especially in developing countries? What have the challenges been?\n\n5. Jihyun: You've focused on water management and sanitation. How have you been addressing this issue in the Mekong area? What needs did the region have and how did you find solutions through partnerships?\n\n6. Kim: What are some of the key projects you've been involved in to address urban issues with sustainable solutions?\n\n7. Jihyun: Also, there are many cross-cutting issues in development, and you are committed to achieving gender equality in the projects you're involved in. Do you have any examples of how you are \"gender mainstreaming\"?\n\n8. Kim: It might be easier to work in the EU where you have common labour and environmental standards, but you also work with different countries and municipal governments like the city of New York. What kind of changes or initiatives would you like to see through platforms like P4G to enable greater collaborations across the globe?\n\n\nThat's where we must leave it. Thank you to Kim Fredenslund, CEO of CLEAN, and Park Jihyeon, Managing Director of JHSUSTAIN for joining us today.\n(S\u00f8nderborg, Denmark) - \ub179\ud654 \n\n(Seoul)",

Rain that started from the west coast early this morning is dropping showers to much of the country. The capital region and west of Gangwon-do Province will see 5 to 20 millimeters of showers. Rain will go away in the late afternoon. \n\n Top temperatures in most regions will be 1 to 3 degrees lower than yesterday getting up to 20 degrees in Seoul, 22 degrees in Daejeon. Meanwhile, those in the south and Jeju could notice much sunnier skies with very strong UV rays. So our evening commute will be much more comfortable.\n\n Keep an umbrella handy, we are looking at heavier rain tomorrow, then the last weekend of May will wrap up on a sunnier note. \n\nThat's Korea for you and here's a look at weather conditions around the world.",
