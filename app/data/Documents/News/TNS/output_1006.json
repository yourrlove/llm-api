I’m Devin Whiting with your News Y headlines in English.The founder of the Internet security firm AhnLab and possible presidentialcandidate, Ahn Cheol-soo has decided to donate about half of his stake inAhnLab to charity, but declined to say whether the decision was related to hispolitical ambitions.Mister Ahn, whose support for Park Won-soon helped Park become mayor of Seoulin last month’s election, said he will donate about 133 million dollars to helpeducate the children of low-income families.After making the announcement, yesterday, he left without taking questions fromreporters.He only said that giving away a large amount of his personal wealth was along-held dream of his.One leading daily paper said the move was Ahn’s way of starting his politicalcareer.Polls suggest he would be a strong challenger in next year’s presidentialelection if he faced the ruling party’s front-runner, Park Geun-hye.President Lee Myung-bak was scheduled to make a rare appearance in parliamenttoday to ask lawmakers to quickly approve the free trade agreement with theUnited States.The opposition Democratic Party, which opposes the FTA, had initially refusedto meet with President Lee last week, but has backed down, apparently worriedabout taking such a hardline stance.DP floor leader Kim Jin-pyo said his party will use the opportunity to tell theadministration that the FTA should not be forced through, but resolved throughdialogue between the two sides.The opposition in particular opposes a provision in the deal that would allowforeign entities to take disputes with the Korean government to aninternational body.New data from the customs office show’s Korea posted a trade surplus of4-point-1 billion dollars last month, up from 1-point-3 billion the previousmonth.Exports remained strong thanks to growth in oil products, vehicles and steel.Eports to the European Union, however, fell more than 30 percent.Finance minister Bahk Jae-wan says Asian countries need to keep theirrestrictions on capital movements because they are vulnerable to externalfactors.Mister Bahk did however say the values of markets at least has to be maintaineduntil a better system comes along.His call for capital controls comes just a day after APEC leaders gathered inHawaii for a summit in which they said Asian markets should open up.The Cabinet has passed a bill ordering convicted draft dodgers to fulfill theirmandatory military service.Under the bill, men who have gone to prison for avoiding service by fraudulentmeans such as injuring themselves, will no longer be exempt.Men who did not finish middle school will lose their exemption as well.A new report suggests women in their twenties are outperforming men in the jobmarket.According to the report by the Korea Labor Institute, 15 years ago aboutthree-quarters of men in their twenties had jobs, but that figure fell to just58 percent as of last year.Meanwhile, the rate for twenty-something women rose by three percentage pointsto the same level as the men.The report attributed the fall in male employment to more men prolonging theireducation due to the tough job market.That’s all for this hour.
