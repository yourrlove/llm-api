15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First, the customer said, I'd like to order a cheeseburger please.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is a polite way of requesting something.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'd like is a common phrase for expressing desires or preferences.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Please is used to make the request more polite.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Next, when the cashier asked, would you like fries and a drink with that?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They were offering additional items to the customer's order.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And when the customer said, here's $10, keep the change.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They were telling the cashier to keep the extra money as a tip.
