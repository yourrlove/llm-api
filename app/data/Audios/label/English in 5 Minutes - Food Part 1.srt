Welcome to English in 5 minutes podcast.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is Hania speaking and today I'm talking again with Chuck.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello Chuck.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello Hania.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good to see you.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's nice to be here.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm going to enjoy this today.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hopefully.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Today we'll be talking about food.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I know that you really like cooking and can you tell me what types of food you really

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
like?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Cooking has been my hobby for many years but since the lockdown I was able to learn how

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to make more things like egg rolls, Indian non-bread.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I really go online and anything that catches my eye.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll experiment.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I like to try different things.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay so when you search for new inspirations it's like you write something in Google like

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
any special word like best recipes ever or what?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I would write like with the Indian non-bread.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I wrote non-bread Indian non-bread and then there are many different kinds just like you

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
have the pierogi here.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can have it with meat or with cheese or with fruit and so this is how I started.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now with the egg rolls I tried every egg roll place here in Leggino and they were all good

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and then I thought hmm they're a little bit pricey so maybe I can try to make this at home.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I went online and I started looking for recipes but a lot of times when you try one

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
recipe you'll come to and like I go to a website called All Recipe and I ask for egg rolls

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and then they'll show me egg rolls but they'll show me 10 other things that I didn't even

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
think about and I thought oh next time maybe I'll try that.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah it's good to try new things and you know non-bread I last ate that I don't know a couple

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
of weeks ago but I bought it in Bittronka but it was pretty tasty.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But the special Indian non-bread has ground meat inside.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's why I said it was kind of like pierogi because you can stuff it and it's flat.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay great.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay so Indian food what about Polish food because our kitchen and Polish cuisine are

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
very fatty and greasy you know and sometimes if you're really full after eating that.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think that's what I love about it that's what we have in Poland.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Poland hasn't come with Texas.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hours too.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Very sometimes very heavy very fat very greasy.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For example you have pierogi we have dumplings.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You have shabovii.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I know I'm saying that long.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We have pork chops.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So we have a lot of the same foods actually.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The difference is the spices because we have the influence from Mexico so we have more

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Tex-Mex with peppers and things like this.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But the Polish kitchen is great.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Have you got any favorite dish?

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Shabovii.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Shabovii.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And my second is pierogi.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
One I never had before that I really liked was interesting when I first had it was biggos.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh I know biggos.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When I first had biggos I wasn't really sure if I liked this.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But then I tried it again in a third time and I love it.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay great.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Any favorite dish that you like to prepare like not Polish dish but something that is

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
your special treatment when you have guests in your house?

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I tried to do something a little bit unusual that they're not used to.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
For example you don't see egg rolls.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
People making egg rolls or people making non-bread.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I guess my signature dish would be I make a chicken with a white wine and cream sauce.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I make that for a lot of friends when they come to the house because that one I can do

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
very well.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I remember some time ago you showed me like lots of pictures of the food that you prepare.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There was like lots of these pictures.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You like to take photos to show your friends like yeah this is my new dish I prepared it

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and now enjoy it and you know get inspired maybe also.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It started just as a diary for myself at the beginning of the pandemic when I started

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to do these new recipes that I had never done before.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Like the first time I did the egg rolls and I thought all right I've never done the egg

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
rolls before.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let me take a picture.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then I would do the non-bread or let me take a picture.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And then I started just taking pictures in the first two months I showed no one.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Even my wife didn't know I had the pictures on the phone.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And then after a while she would come home and sometimes I forgot so I would make the

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
plate and take the picture and then she noticed.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And then she asked me to let me see your phone.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I showed her the phone and she said oh you're taking all the pictures.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Long list.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I tried to take a picture of every new thing that I make or if I make an old recipe a

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
little bit differently.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
English in five minutes.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Good conversation.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This frustration.
